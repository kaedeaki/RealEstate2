As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!  \n",

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.  \n",

The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.  Kudos all round.  "

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!</td>\n",

The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!   \n",

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them   \n",

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.   \n",

They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL   \n",
              "4  On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.  Kudos all round.   \n",

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!  \n",

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them  \n",

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions.

              "4  On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.  While waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.  By mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance.

We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options\\u2026 give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I\\u2019ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

Installers and electricians ready to go. As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!   \n",

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them   \n",

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.   \n",

While waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.  By mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.  Kudos all round.   \n",

            "13  WOULD 110% NOT RECOMMEND! -First off one head was installed in the wrong spot from what we spoke about because the other spot was just more work. So it's now in a spot that doesn't even warm the rest of the basement just the laundry room. -drain hose was just placed in the laundry room sink not ran outside the way it should be. -only had it for a couple of months, the head upstairs doesn't blow heat just cold air. -outside condenser makes loud clunking noises also condenser was installed right In front of a dryer vent which causes lots of lent build up on coils of condenser. -We paid extra for parts and labor warranty only for them to make us trouble shoot it ourselves or we would have to pay extra for someone to come. -very rude on the phone and lies. -not considered that we have a newborn and another child in the house and our heating not working and power bill going through the roof because we're using space heaters, so much for saving money by switching to heat pumps. - calls us saying a tech will FINALLY be by only for them to not show up, no text, emails or phone Calls explaining why they didn't.

Thanks to his expertise, we were able to secure a fantastic product deal, and the entire process, from signing to financing, took just an hour. Although there was a slight delay in our installation timeline due to unforeseen weather challenges in Nova Scotia, the team at 1 Click kept us informed throughout. Their dedication to quality service is truly commendable. I wholeheartedly give them five stars and am grateful to George for his outstanding assistance.\"   \n",

Garbage company very ignorance. Yes got free ecobee thermostat, instilled by very unprofessional elections. Most of employees do not know what they are doing after the installation we had problem with the ac and called them I addressed the matter to them they come right away and fix the problem here was some wiring issue that they did not do right. We had same problem yesterday after tring to put our heat on cold air coming when I called and addressed the matter to Melanie she starts giving attitude and claiming that we got the  free service and should not call them anymore. Also she claimed that we do not know how to use the ecobee thermostat. The problem is been resolved by different companies and had to pay $300 for their mistakes. Please avoid this garbage company in any cost very rude and unprofessional employees. their elections do not know what they are doing and they do not speak English.   \n",

At first they told me I was wrong and that it was done exactly as I had asked, then they said they could arrange to have it moved but I would not only have to pay for that but would also have to pay for the damages to my home myself, they now have not responded other than to tell me that they will get back to me for over a month   \n",

We just recently bought a home and found out shortly after that our AC was broken. With summer just around the corner we were happy that we were able to install a new unit so quickly! I’m so grateful for the great customer service we received when it came to figuring out what option was best, installation, etc. I would recommend to all friends and family!   \n",

The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!   \n",

Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.  By mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.

The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

We had  some very old worn and torn vinyl siding on a section of our house that needed replacing and we have an older detached garage with a low slope roof that was in dire need of a total roof & decking replacement and upgrade. The end results went way above our expectations and their workmanship was stellar. They provide highly detailed and itemized quotes and they explain clearly what the work will entail. On top of that, they're all professional and super friendly and provide excellent lines of communication so you're never in the dark about anything. I highly recommend them!   \n",

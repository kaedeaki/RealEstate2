            "review_text": "We purchased our home from Activa around 2022. Our experience with them was great, and we wanted to share our story with Activa.\n\nWhen we were chosen to purchase a house from Activa, we were excited as it was very competitive. Dave, who was the representative , was able to help us through the process before design studio.\n\nAfter we chose our lot and went through structural upgrades with Dave, we went to design studio to choose designs and trims that go into our house. Maggie was our designer. She was very professional and friendly to work with. We were a picky customer and we changed our choices a lot, but she was very nice and understanding. She also suggested us a lot in terms of choosing. Now our home looks amazing thanks to her.\n\nWhen we were done with choices, Tammy was able to take care of all the questions we had. I think that building a home with a builder can arise many questions because it is a complex process and some things can be hard to understand. We just had to email Tammy and she was able to answer every question, which gave us a peace of mind.\n\nAfter the home was built and when we were going through warranty process (before closing, after closing), Scott and his team acted quick and worked in a very professional matter. They were paying attention to small details and we were able to correct and fix most of the issues we were able to find. Quality of the build went up higher after we went through home with Scott.\n\nThe whole process of purchasing a house from Activa was easier than what we expected and they were very professional. We would recommend Activa to any buyers who are willing to purchase a house from builder. Activa will get you a great quality home with less headaches you have to get. We appreciate Activa’s professionalism, and for a great house.",

It was a very simple and easy to understand process. We really liked the design studio aspect which many builders do not come close to - Activa has it's own building that allows you to see all the options they have. They also provide options for buildings secondary suites which can be necessary in this day and age. ,The supervisor that I dealt with after closing was Scott. He was extremely professional. Very helpful and was able to resolve all my PDI and 30-day warranty items extremely fast. He was also very courteous and helping me with things that don't generally get covered under normal warranty work. I would recommend this builder to anyone and ask for Scott. He's been amazing. Activa did not disappoint.",

The installers were professional and positive, respectful of my home and helpful with information and letting me know what was happening.  The office staff were equally wonderful to work with and of course, I love my new Lennox furnace...it's so quiet and runs like a charm! Thank you, Alma, for doing a great job and caring about your customer! I highly recommend Alma to everyone!",

            "review_text": "Customer for 10 years  have had service in the past.  Recently called for info on a warning light on the furnace and they said they couldn't help me and directed me elsewhere.  Tried to return a brand new furnace filter over $40 value, again after buying them twice yearly for 10 years  and Shane tells me they don't have a return policy.  So $800 worth of filters I buy, but when I need to return one extra I purchased they won't return it.  Poor business etiquette, definitely would not recommend them.  Customer service goes a long way, and here there is zero so why give them business.",

            "review_text": "Dozens of contractors are available in the London area.  However, if you want the best for your build or remodel, you must use CCR.  Arne Madsen, the owner, is a terrific person with a keen eye for design and detail.  He has attracted a skilled group of employees and hires reliable sub trades. Their work is first rate plus and has been recognized with dozens of awards. CCR will do your job start-to-finish, from getting the building permit to completing final touches to your satisfaction.\n\nWe hired CCR to remove our old deck and build a new one. Because we have a walkout, the deck is 9 feet above the patio. The old deck was not covered. CCR extended the existing roof over the new deck. It is impossible to distinguish where the new roof connects to the existing roof, as it is a perfect piece of workmanship.   The ceiling finish on the deck is stylish as is the finish of the underside of the deck and the underside of the stairs both of which are finished with the same material as the existing soffit and fascia. Our neighbor, who has expertise in construction, informally followed the work and inspected the finished deck. He commented on the high quality of construction and attractiveness of the new deck. We are extremely pleased with the work done by CCR and are enjoying our new deck!",

Sad the builder does not care or not even acknowledging emails.\n\nAs soon as Dawn and Warren came on board I can give them 5star as the communication has been so clear and no run arounds. Dawn and Warren really helped close loops and returned phone calls. They both have amazing customer service skills. Thank you!",

Brandy's knowledge and expertise were evident, and she went above and beyond to make sure we felt confident in our decision.\n\nWe are now excited to begin the journey of building our dream home with Fusion Homes, and we have Brandy to thank for that. Her continued support and dedication are exactly what we need as we move forward in this process. We feel like we are in capable hands, and that is a great comfort.\n\nThank you, Brandy, for making this experience so much smoother and for helping us turn our dream home into a reality. Your assistance has been invaluable, and we look forward to working with you and Fusion Home Company to see our vision come to life.",

Example, this landing before our stairs has been fixed 3 times… it’s uneven and looks horrible. Customer Service is nice and respond quickly but the results from the end products is disappointing. The process exhausted me from escalating it anymore and simply accept this is the best it will be.\n\nDeb McCarthy was our sales rep (the Glade) and she was wonderful, personable and helped us so much!! Unlike the current sales rep who isn’t very friendly.\n\nNick is absolutely amazing he’s kind and such a hard worker. Fusion Homes should be very grateful for such a wonderful employee.\n\nIn the end, it’s things like these steps that I have to look and use every day and be reminded of the fact that the sale is done and they’ve “fixed” the issue and hope I don’t follow up again…",

Monica was gracious and patient with our questions in the sale process. On the design side, we were limited only by our imagination, and Stacy and team were enthusiastic about working with our ideas.  Energy independence was important to us, and we had no issues bringing in a supplier for solar generation and storage. Brad was highly accommodating and responsive to email and helped with the numerous questions we had.\n\nThe home was completed exactly on schedule, and the construction and finishing quality is superb. I would highly recommend Gemini Homes and most definitely work with them again.",

We worked with both him and Kate on flooring, colours, kitchen cabinets, but for most of the project, we simply left it up to Scott to do what he would do if he owned the home.  It made the process a lot less stressful for us, and we are sure we might the right choice.  As the project progressed and some other choices came up, he was always willing to do what was needed.  We were very pleased with the entire renovation, and all the work and help that Scott, Kate and their employees provided.  The entire team was a pleasure to work with.  I would strongly advise anyone who wants quality work, done by good people, to call Holman Construction Inc.  We are sure glad they were referred to us and very much appreciate all that they did!

Building a home during Covid was not a great experience but still not an excuse for some of the poor quality trades Longwood uses.\n\nIf you are not prepared to take time off work waiting for trades to not show up and then finally come to access (some came as many as 4 times for the same issue) and return without proper replacement parts just save your self the headache. We used weeks of vacation time to accommodate appointments and many hours of time in correspondence to get things done.\n\nMany items on our list should have been completed prior to occupancy. Some items were major and took hours of emailing  up the chain to get results.  There were well over a 100 items on our PDI.\n\nPositives are that we love the layout and location of our home.",

They were pricey a little, but I didn't have to worry about scheduling plumbers, tilers, electricians etc...they managed these craftsmen expertly for me. Moreover, they provided welcome design features like offsetting subway tiles in our shower that look really sharp.

            "review_text": "Working with the team at Toronto Deck and Rail was a good experience. The final product was done to our satisfaction and the customer service was good from initial contact through to their techs. I took away one star because I think a couple of things could have been handled better:\n\n1. Measurements are sent by the customer and then transcribed by customer service, this is not a problem unless you are getting glass panels which need to be custom cut. From the initial impression,  it was not clear that a follow up visit would be required to install the glass panels (one-two weeks after the railings were installed).\n\n2. The post bases do not come with a cover for the base plate/ bolts. Although not a big deal, per se, they leave the railings with a bit of an unfinished look. I’m told that several customers have provided this feedback so the company is planning to include them in future designs. This would have been nice to know ahead of time.\n\nNote, the base bolts do not come in the colour of the railings, which draws even more attention to them. I requested the techs paint the bolts before leaving, to which they obliged.\n\nI’ve attached some photos to give prospective customers a reference.\n\nOverall, I’m satisfied with my experience and end product.",

He & his team arrived at the advised time, and the job was completed quickly and professionally.\n\nI was particularly impressed with their solution to solve the problem of a broken step at the bottom of my porch; they installed the railing with an extension over the broken area, providing a safe hand support while maintaining the structural strength of the railing itself.\n\nThe invoicing and payment process was easy and seamless; they have a secure on-line payment portal for quick settlement, and provide comprehensive invoices and receipts.\n\nI was extremely satisfied with these folks, and would not hesitate to recommend them.",

            "review_text": "Tridel's Disheartening Experience: A Buyer's Regret\n\nI find myself compelled to share my experience with Tridel, and I must admit, it's left me deeply disheartened. Unlike my seamless dealings with developers such as Mattamy, Centre Court, and Pure Plaza, Tridel's customer service has been a letdown.\n\nTaking occupancy at The Well in downtown Toronto on August 2, 2023, I encountered many unexpected hurdles. To rent out my suite during interim occupancy, everyone is obliged to engage their in-house leasing company, Del Condominiums Realty. Just so everyone knows they charge the first month's rent and an ongoing 6% fee of the monthly rent. Whereas, with other developers you are free to rent out the unit either yourself or hire a 3rd party company that you want to go with. But with Tridel properties you have to go with their in-house team, so you are bound to them, so with Tridel their is less flexibility.\n\nRegrettably, my journey with Tridel has presented several challenges:\n\n1. Title Transfer Turmoil: Tridel's insistence on approval from their exclusive list of lenders felt restrictive and arbitrary. As a self-employed individual, this requirement posed unnecessary complications. Unlike other developers, Tridel's rigidity in this matter left me feeling powerless.\n\n2. Rental Roadblocks with Del Condominiums Realty:\n\n•Their attribution of rental difficulties to a \"difficult market\" contradicts the experiences of others in the same scenario. When one pays for a service, it is reasonable to expect tangible results, not just excuses. (Till Date, they have NOT been able to rent out my unit, which in return is costing me thousands of dollars monthly)\n\n•During the design process, I followed their specialist's advice to install an island, incurring an additional expense. Now, Tridel cites it as an issue. This inconsistency in their stance is both perplexing and frustrating.\n\n•My persistent efforts to seek updates on my unit's status have been met with silence. Calls, texts, emails - all seemingly disregarded. This lack of responsiveness is disheartening, especially considering the fees involved.\n\n3. Lack of Cohesion and Accountability: Tridel's internal teams appear disconnected, operating in silos. Coordination between sales, customer service, and Del Condominiums Realty is evidently lacking. This lack of cohesion has left me feeling isolated and disheartened.\n\nIn all honesty, I find myself in a state of helplessness. Tridel's policies and practices have left me feeling trapped and undervalued as a customer. I share this account not as a mere critique, but as a plea to potential buyers to exercise caution. While Tridel may boast a reputable name, the absence of genuine concern for customer concerns is a glaring shortcoming.\n\nIts been about 3 weeks and nobody from Del Reality Team, Sales team and Customer Service Team at Tridel has provided me with any concrete answer to my questions. The entire organization has been bouncing me back and forth in between each other.\n\nThere is zero accountability with anyone at this organization.",

I got in touch with Roberto and he was super helpful over the phone as well as e-mail.  He told me exactly what he needed, how much it was going to cost, gave me a timeline and was able to get us all of the final paperwork way quicker than we had originally anticipated.  He was pleasant to deal with and great with communication throughout the whole process.  An added bonuses was that everything we needed was much cheaper than I was anticipating.  I highly recommend Roberto and UCC for anyone looking for a professional, affordable, great-overall communication and experience regarding survey and grading plans for your pool permitting needs.  I will be sure to recommend to anyone needing this service moving forward.  Roberto and UCC will be my go-to if the opportunity arises where I need another survey in the future.  Thanks again for your great service!  It's greatly appreciated!",

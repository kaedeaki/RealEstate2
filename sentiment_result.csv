Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Ratna Prabha Singh,5,We purchased a home from Activa and closing happened in July this year. The overall experience and process was smooth and well dealt with in spite of challenges posed due to COVID restrictions. They were all with us during the design to building stage and responded to each query and issues promptly and efficiently. They made us feel like family and always solved our issues however tiny or complex they were and ensured timely delivery. Staff is very friendly and top notch. Post delivery service was on point and it was a thorough professional engagement throughout. Kudos to team Activa and all the best for all their future projects.

I’ll forever be grateful to their customer service and construction team. I closed my property with them couple weeks ago … Had they not accommodated the on-time closing of my unit, I would have risked losing my pre-approved mortgage (2.5%) that was offered to me two years ago.

Activa's entire staff has been very supportive and pleasant to work with… Megan, Jen , Jessica and Others … Thank you all.

Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Ko Hyunjun,5,"We purchased our home from Activa around 2022. Our experience with them was great, and we wanted to share our story with Activa.

When we were chosen to purchase a house from Activa, we were excited as it was very competitive. Dave, who was the representative , was able to help us through the process before design studio.

After we chose our lot and went through structural upgrades with Dave, we went to design studio to choose designs and trims that go into our house. Maggie was our designer. She was very professional and friendly to work with. We were a picky customer and we changed our choices a lot, but she was very nice and understanding. She also suggested us a lot in terms of choosing. Now our home looks amazing thanks to her.

When we were done with choices, Tammy was able to take care of all the questions we had. I think that building a home with a builder can arise many questions because it is a complex process and some things can be hard to understand. We just had to email Tammy and she was able to answer every question, which gave us a peace of mind.

After the home was built and when we were going through warranty process (before closing, after closing), Scott and his team acted quick and worked in a very professional matter. They were paying attention to small details and we were able to correct and fix most of the issues we were able to find. Quality of the build went up higher after we went through home with Scott.

The whole process of purchasing a house from Activa was easier than what we expected and they were very professional. We would recommend Activa to any buyers who are willing to purchase a house from builder. Activa will get you a great quality home with less headaches you have to get. We appreciate Activa’s professionalism, and for a great house.",POSITIVE,0.9980857372283936

It was a very simple and easy to understand process. We really liked the design studio aspect which many builders do not come close to - Activa has it's own building that allows you to see all the options they have. They also provide options for buildings secondary suites which can be necessary in this day and age. ,The supervisor that I dealt with after closing was Scott. He was extremely professional. Very helpful and was able to resolve all my PDI and 30-day warranty items extremely fast. He was also very courteous and helping me with things that don't generally get covered under normal warranty work. I would recommend this builder to anyone and ask for Scott. He's been amazing.

They took the time to understand our needs and helped us choose the perfect design that would fit our family's lifestyle.

The building process was incredibly smooth and efficient. The construction team (Scott and his team)  kept us informed every step of the way and any issues that arose were promptly addressed. The end result was a beautiful, high-quality home that was exactly what we had envisioned.

We particularly appreciated the attention to detail that Activa Homes put into every aspect of the build. From the choice of materials to the finishes, every decision was made with the goal of delivering a home that was not only beautiful, but also built to last.

Understanding Activa is a volume builder, Activa exceeded our expectations by offering some level of customization that make our house an unique one.

You show cracked concrete they will say yet not wide enough to repair, you tell them u are having water pressure problem they will tell u it is city problem though none of your neighbors have the issue and some complaints if they take they will postpone the fix until u are out of warranty.  I hope my frustration is heard by enough for them to decide not to go for this builder. To quote a instance, I have yet not completed two years of warranty, my shingles are missing, I requested a repair, they said Tarion wnty on shingles is for one year, if I have to get it repaired , I should go to roofing guys.

Just Bought unit a month ago, Request for extension for closing for extra 2 months due to reason, not even a think a single time and remind me a agreement signed by customer care agent's email with screenshot of wordings,  treat like bought pizza slice from store. These guys have no sense that product you are selling for 1 Million not for $10 Pizza. Evan store owner pizza will change by request of customer.

Please buyer read a Agreement twice before a sign, keep a in loop with your lawyer before sign agreement, Builder will not listen your single word after sign agreement so take a time and go through your agreement word by word.  There many loopholes for builder to squeez to buyer in this agreement of Activa. Sales rep just interested to sign a agreement and will disappear soon once signed. Customer service also bad , didn't think that they should give solution to client , just asking 2 or 3 month extension before evan construction start and they remind me a agreement.

'given that this is an issue stemming from the appliance and not the house leaking, there is nothing we can do'

The laundry room drain we upgraded and paid for is for when my HOUSE LEAKS but not for when my washing machine leaks???? What????  The drain still wouldn't catch water if my 'house leaked.' This is an absurd explanation - wow!
--------------------------------------------
Original review:
We built our home with Active and on top of many issues, recently we had a small flood in our top floor laundry room. I contacted customer service to discuss a refund for the $500 (!!) upgrade we paid to install a drain in our laundry room at the time of it being built to protect ourselves. Unfortunately, not one drop of the water went down the drain. This was their response:

'The floor drain would only be able to capture some water, and only if water was directly over the top if it.  Water would need to be directed to the floor drain manually. We will not be able to assist in a reimbursement of the floor drain.'

I am not sure about others, but I don't sit and stare at my washing machine running every time, waiting for it to flood so I can push the water towards the back corner of the laundry closet 'manually'.

Do not upgrade for a floor drain - it was completely useless.

We were new to the process but felt like it was so easy to follow and felt very involved with everything. We couldn't be happier with the process and with the customer service. We felt like we were cared for and that our concerns were met.
We were given a instruction binder to follow for dates and what to expect for our inspections etc. This gave us direction and made us feel comfortable with the process. This really impressed me as it showed that they were professional.
The design studio was a exciting experience! We visited multiple times on our own before our appointment to walk through the area. All of our questions were answered with ease. When we had our design appointment, we did not feel pressured to upgrade. Our designer was great at matching to our styles and did a wonderful job at pulling out multiple swatches/floor tiles etc.
We are moved in and settled and my partner and I cannot say ""I love our house!"" enough. We are so happy with the results and the quality of our home. Any issues we had were taken care of quickly.

During our building process there have been several occasions where they completely disregard or take ownership for mistakes or issues on Activa's end. During a pre drywall inspection the site super informed us of ""copy and paste"" mistakes that are made frequently when it comes to upgrades and designs during the design appointment. The site super also gave us his word of things that would be corrected after our pre drywall inspection and or final walk through, these items are still left undone. Upon moving into our home, it was filthy. It was not cleaned. I had emailed about getting our windows cleaned as there is stucco on our windows. I was told that someone would come by. I am still waiting to have my windows cleaned. We have an electrical issue and the site coordinator has ignored the request of having someone come to take a look sooner. She is quick to email when she needs an answer or something but all the issues that me and my partner bring to Activa require us to chase them. The professionalism of this company is embarrassing. The entire building process was not a fun, exciting or enjoyable process because of the lack of customer service in this company. I do love my home, but dealing with these people is a nightmare! I do not feel confident that issues with my home will be address properly and we will have to pay out of pocket to have things done correctly since Activa takes no ownership.

We had originally thought of building a bungalow in the carriage crossing community because of its location and complexity of walking and biking trails. We knew that Activa was developing this site and reached out to them to discuss our plans. It was suggested that one of the condominium town homes might meet our needs, and after looking at the plans available and the location, we decided this would be a great fit for us!

Right from our first meeting with Coldwell Banker we knew we had made the right decision. We were impressed with the professionalism of the Activa staff who always treated us with respect and kindness right from the start, through the design process and into the building and occupancy phases.

After we had a disastrous accident with a brand new refrigerator which blew a hose and started to flood the kitchen, Activa came to the rescue and replaced all the damaged baseboards even though they were not at fault in any way! We were very grateful for their concern and willingness to make things right.

We have now gone through the first Tarion report process and Activa have been excellent in fixing any deficiencies and we feel confident that they will follow through with the next stage of the process which will include the landscaping and exterior work.

We would not hesitate to recommend Activa to our friends. Their concern for the customer and attention to detail is exceptional. We are very grateful to them for making our move stress free and painless!

Sincerely
Alan and Marion Burtenshaw",POSITIVE,0.9984629154205322
Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Disha Kapoor,1,"Scam! Rigged! Hoax!
Activa sends you Google Form to express your interest in purchasing home for their new phase/release of projects. They say they evaluate all submissions. Ask them?!!! how do they evaluate these applications? You don't ask for copy of mortgage pre-approvals, don't ask for any photo ID proof in the google form, don't evaluate on first-come, first-serve basis. How are they exactly selecting clients for purchase appointments? Upon asking about criteria of evaluation, they say randomly selected. What does that even mean? They are deceptive and only give their projects to people who they have networks with-family, friends and realtor working for them. I even asked them if I need a real estate agent to represent me before I submit my application, they said no. There is no transparency. We have been eagerly wanting to purchase a home with Activa and had all the documents ready including mortgage approvals but they do nothing but mislead an ordinary citizen, with no special powers and contact in real estate. Disappointing!",NEGATIVE,0.9999867677688599
Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Sean Alexander,1,"I would give 0 stars if possible.
My fiance and I purchased an 11 year old house in the Laurentian West (Activa) that was built by this company. Due to the housing market, we did not have time to do a home inspection on the house. I have been working as a building designer for 15 years across the country, and I have never seen such poor quality in work. This house was poorly constructed, and multiple short cuts were taken during construction. All this company cares about is putting up as many houses as possible, in a short amount of time, then moving on to the next area. Avoid this company at all cost. There are much better home builders out there
Here is a list of things that I know that the home builder had to do by code, but did not do.
- The crawl space had no insulation. (I had to add the insulation)
- The floor in our bedroom over the garage has no insulation in it
- There are exterior walls in the house that have no insulation in it (You can feel the cold air during the winter from the outside through the wall)
- The gutters were not properly attached to the roof (Found this out as the fell off the house)
- The attic has very little (nowhere near enough) insulation in it.
- The sump pump was improperly installed. (I fixed this during a large rain storm)
- The soil around the house is not graded away from the house. Water runs back towards the house.
- The furnace was a cheap Chinese model, that they obviously bought in bulk to save money.
All these points are known in the neighborhood as issues by the builder.",NEGATIVE,0.9999954700469971

Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Christine T,5,"Our journey with Activa began when we slowly (but anxiously) started researching new neighbourhoods in the Kitchener/Waterloo area. We were looking to upgrade from our condo to a detached home, so we hoped to find a trusted builder locally. The search didn’t last long when we discovered that Activa had recently acquired East Forest Homes (the builder of our first condo) so we new we had to pay them a visit! Once we found the new Activa development in Vista Hills, the process ended up moving along quite quickly! It was a perfect neighbourhood match; family friendly, tons of walking trails, and just a quick 5 minute drive to all amenities. We first met with Greg to review some of the available lots and explore the different models. Greg was super informative, giving us even more detail on future plans of the neighbourhood. We selected our lot and model, and just like that the process had begun! A few months after securing our lot, we had our first meeting with Maggie at the design studio. We had visited previously to try and get a grasp on colours and a few other selections. This helped get the design appointment moving a little quicker. Maggie had a real eye for coordinating patterns and colours. She really helped us feel confident in our decisions. Once the construction began, we were introduced to Juliana. Juliana was responsible for communicating building updates and keeping us informed as our empty lot slowly started to transform into a home! We met with Juliana multiple times throughout the process, including our pre-drywall inspection. We were given the opportunity to visit our home 2 or 3 more times to make sure our custom kitchen and bathroom designs were just as we expected. The weeks leading up to delivery were seamless. Along with Juliana, we were also introduced to Chris, the site supervisor. We had our “final"" walk through 2 weeks before our closing date. We got to review all the finishing inside and mark anything we felt needed to be looked at by the Activa team. Juliana and Chris were both present for this and super helpful as we tested everything in the house. Finally, the day before closing, we walked through one final time to make sure everything was just as expected - and of course, it was perfect! We couldn’t express how excited we were to move into our new house!
Over the course of the following few months, Juliana was very responsive as a few final items got checked off our 30 day list.
Since move-in, we have taken time in enjoying the process of making this new house our home! We are truly thankful for Activa’s attention to detail, communication and diligence in helping us through every step of the building process.",POSITIVE,0.9997671246528625

My windows have leaked and water continues to purge in my house. A ""design flaw"" is all I was ever told about my unit and why ice damming continues on the majority of the units in my subdivision.  This company is a joke. They did nothing since winter weather in always an act of nature and not covered under Tarion Home warranty.

Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Raja Mudhar,1,"This company is the worst, I usually don't leave reviews since I feel that they don't go anywhere, but I had to leave this comment. Before Activa they used to be Eastforest homes and I know that Activa isnt any better than Eastforest. The closing on our house was back 2017 when we moved in the builder had already laid our sod, but no one was there to water, so when we moved in our grass was dead, at that time sod season was done but had made the phone call right away and they mentioned that other homes around the area have had the same problem and will get to the bottom of this, forward to the new sod season, it was a fight to get them to fix the grass and after the back and fourth someone finally came out to fertilize it. Now the battle is with the driveway, before Activa bought out Eastforest, they had completed our driveways with the first coat of asphalt and we were told that after one year they would complete the second coat, the first coat was such a terrible job where the driveway has sunk in, just TERRIBLE. All the other Eastforest homes received their second coat last year, so I was expecting mines this year since this was what I was told, and not just my driveway but 4-5 other houses on the street, since Activa bought out Eastforest all the Activa houses got their second coat of asphalt. So I've emailed them and their response is that our home agreement did not include a second coat of asphalt????? So why is that all the other Eastforest homes got the second coat and also now why the Activa houses got a second coat and all but 4-5 houses dont have that in their agreement? I find that completely NONSENSE. It seems like Activa doesnt want to endure the expense of that Eastforest left off. A BUNCH OF LIARS.",NEGATIVE,0.9999972581863403

CCR Build + Remodel,ChIJ-0bany_lLogRUBnpws5gzI4,James L. Stouffer,5,"Dozens of contractors are available in the London area.  However, if you want the best for your build or remodel, you must use CCR.  Arne Madsen, the owner, is a terrific person with a keen eye for design and detail.  He has attracted a skilled group of employees and hires reliable sub trades. Their work is first rate plus and has been recognized with dozens of awards. CCR will do your job start-to-finish, from getting the building permit to completing final touches to your satisfaction.

We hired CCR to remove our old deck and build a new one. Because we have a walkout, the deck is 9 feet above the patio. The old deck was not covered. CCR extended the existing roof over the new deck. It is impossible to distinguish where the new roof connects to the existing roof, as it is a perfect piece of workmanship.   The ceiling finish on the deck is stylish as is the finish of the underside of the deck and the underside of the stairs both of which are finished with the same material as the existing soffit and fascia. Our neighbor, who has expertise in construction, informally followed the work and inspected the finished deck. He commented on the high quality of construction and attractiveness of the new deck.

The CCR team masterfully executed the renovation and created an open concept design that has transformed our home from a dated 1970s bungalow to a beautiful modern living space that we love!

From the first meeting with Arne, we knew that we wanted to hire CCR. His attention to detail, suggestions and vision were appreciated from beginning to end. He hires master craftsmen/women who are talented, respectful and were a real joy to welcome into our home. They arrived on time, on schedule and left our home clean and well kept each day. We cannot say enough wonderful comments about our site supervisor John McDermott; a gentle giant, whose talents amazed us and his attention to detail ensured we were beyond pleased with the finished product. Customers are very fortunate to have John on their project.

The entire CCR team, Lonny, Donnie, Ross, Andrew, Jenn and especially Justin who keeps all the selections and decisions on track and on time, were exceptional. Our electrician Steve deserves our sincere appreciation for his attention to detail and his vision as well; lighting makes the space warm and bright and Steve did a fabulous job!

Choosing a renovation company is daunting, but when you choose a company like CCR, you can relax and know that your project is in good hands.

Arne is a stickler for details and won't accept work that isn't up to his high standards and that is an awesome quality to have in a renovation company!

There were several bumps along the way, that were not related to CCR, but that CCR helped me navigate. They were professional, kind, humorous, and produced a high quality final product that I absolutely adore. They were compassionate and mindful of finances. They were open and honest about what could and could not be accomplished. They allowed me to make decisions but yet ensured that the building pieces were completed safely and by code. They have an incredible sense for detail, which was super important to me. I would recommend this company to everyone. These guys feel like family.

I had already done a fair amount of research and had a good idea of the specifics of what I wanted.  Peder was happy to work with my plans but also made valuable suggestions during the design process that improved certain aspects and also helped keep the budget reasonable.  There were unanticipated issues in obtaining the building permit, both the city requiring several variances and also permissions from the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) because the property is adjacent to an ESA.  At times I felt a bit overwhelmed by this process, but Peder was reassuring and doggedly pursued both the city and UTRCA until all issues were satisfied and the building permit was issued.
Once started work progressed well.  For example when the original siding sub-contractor was unable to install the siding on schedule Peder located another siding installer to keep the project moving along.  The crew from CCR was dedicated, friendly and helpful, they quickly addressed any questions or concerns I had during the construction process.  I am happy with the overall project and the quality of CCR’s work.

CCR Build + Remodel,ChIJ-0bany_lLogRUBnpws5gzI4,David Arbuthnot,5,"Our first experience with a home renovation couldn’t have been better!  The project involved renovating a condo unit to make it wheelchair accessible in a number of rooms.  This included a new island in the kitchen, reconfiguring the ensuite shower and vanities, closets throughout and some changes within the laundry room.  We also added a feature wall in the office, a new fireplace and did a complete repaint. Arne and team really took the time to listen and understand our needs as the requirements were very detailed and specific.

Working within a condo presents many challenges and at the start of the project we weren’t sure how CCR would manage it all, but it quickly became apparent any concerns we had were unfounded as Arne and team handled all the details for us. They got the all the necessary approvals from the property management and used only the trades approved by the condominium corporation for electrical and plumbing changes. Additionally this project was further complicated by the initial lockdown and then all the new restrictions and challenges of the pandemic.  This added some time to the schedule but we were kept informed throughout the project.  BuilderTrend was a great tool to keep the lines of communications open since we were offsite for the entire project.

The time Arne took during the design phase allowed us to use existing cabinetry to minimize waste and costs while still making the new island, counters, backsplashes and cabinetry integrate seamlessly.  Repurposing old counters and appliances to a local charity was important to us and CCR made that possible.

Everyone’s attention to detail and craftsmanship resulted in a beautifully finished renovation.  The kitchen island looks fabulous and provides a wonderful open and accessible workspace.  Joe at Cabico used great creativity and engineering to make this unusual structure sound.  How they managed to get the massive granite pieces for the countertops up the condo elevators still amazes us. Every individual on the CCR team worked patiently with us, they also work with true commitment to the quality of the finished product.

As a woman on my own, this felt like a very daunting process, but CCR made it a smoother process than I expected and exceeded my expectations.

Peder Madsen did a great job explaining everything to me in terms of scope of work, budget and timing.  Their change order process was very clear and they let me know where I stood relative to expenses at all times.

Special thanks also to my designer Myra Tuer for keeping us all on track and for helping me make all the major decisions regarding design, finishes, products, etc.

Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Sandra Swiet,2,"Beware of things that are “free” or “included “ with the purchase of your home as these items are done by contractors and the quality is poor (such as driveway, grass/levelling of ground). Example, this landing before our stairs has been fixed 3 times… it’s uneven and looks horrible. Customer Service is nice and respond quickly but the results from the end products is disappointing. The process exhausted me from escalating it anymore and simply accept this is the best it will be.

Deb McCarthy was our sales rep (the Glade) and she was wonderful, personable and helped us so much!! Unlike the current sales rep who isn’t very friendly.

Nick is absolutely amazing he’s kind and such a hard worker. Fusion Homes should be very grateful for such a wonderful employee.

Having lived in three homes built by Fusion, I already had a such deep appreciation for the company. However, the most recent experience of building my dream home with Fusion Homes has truly meant the world to me. From the moment I started my home building journey to the final handover, the team at Fusion Homes went above and beyond to exceed all my expectations. They created a space that I am immensely proud to call my home.

From the sales process, to the design of the home, to the incredible construction team, all the way to customer care, I’ve been completely blown away by the team's attention to detail, commitment to quality, and undeniable care for me each step of the way. Every nook and cranny of my home reflects the hard work and unbelievable dedication the team has poured into my journey.

I can't even begin to describe how much I adore my new home. Fusion Homes made my dream a reality, delivering a space that far exceeds anything I ever imagined.

Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Brad Ufkes,5,"We are two years into our home ownership with Fusion homes here at The Glade. Our experience up until now has been nothing short of amazing. Initially we were hesitant to purchase pre-construction as we have heard horror stories from friends and family about other pre-con home builders. However, its been fantastic so far working with the team at Fusion. They are always very responsive and have gone above and beyond to address any concerns we've had throughout the two years we've lived here. Fusion has done such an incredible job from start to finish. We recently had a third party home inspection done and the inspector was very impressed with how well built the home was.

In particular I want to highlight Greg Dann at The Glade community. He especially has been an absolute joy to work with. He has gone to great lengths to help us solve any and all issues that have come up with our home as well as follow up to make sure we are satisfied. He is a consummate professional in every way and you can tell he takes great pride in his work. His customer service skills are top notch and its clear he cares a great deal about the homeowners in his community.

Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Mena Hanna,5,"This builder stands by their homes. I’ve been in my home, built by fusion for 4 years now and these guys continue to support any issues that come up that were flagged from the beginning. They don’t try to cut corners or make excuses but they do take time to investigate issues and understandably so. They inspect issues and collect proof in order to find a root cause and at first I was frustrated with this process and it’s tediousness but when they finally tackled the issues I had, they were rectified properly and professionally.

I had a tile issues in the kitchen where the tiles were basically floating on the subfloor and not attached. It happens, builders hire trades and not all trades are equal. Also not every employee at those trades are equal so sometimes you’ll have an issue with pluming, electrical, framing etc….it happens but what sets builders apart is their support AFTER you take possession.

The tiles in my kitchen were repaired 4 times throughout me living here without hesitation from fusion. Upon investigating the issue for the 4th and final time they realized that this was a much bigger issue than a few tiles coming loose and decided to throughly investigate the problem and from there they began to tear apart my entire kitchen down to the subfloor. They were even prepared to tear apart the subfloor if they had to! Long story short, they had to re-tile my entire kitchen. They didn’t want to take any chances, they went as far as taking out the island and the cabinet bases which was honestly going overboard but they were really determined this time to put this issue to rest. To my surprise, this wasn’t a subfloor issue and the subfloor was actually installed very well, it was a tile installation issue which put my mind at ease after thinking I had a poorly built home with loose subfloors…a much more serious chronic issue.

I can’t thank these guys enough for their professionalism. From the beginning, my interaction with the managers Adam Hummel and Alyssia Bezzina was straight forward and reassuring and they were sincere in their dealings with my family. From there they took the reins and started planning out how they’re going to tackle this issue in the least amount of time possible to minimize intrusion.

The service GM that looked after the work was Adam Hewlett and he was honest and truthful which goes a long way with me. What made it obvious was the fact that he wasn’t trying to defend fusion or the tile trade who installed the tile until they tore apart the kitchen and did a thorough investigation with proof of the underlying root-cause…he didn’t come in here with an agenda to sweep things under the rug and I appreciated that. Adam H made sure the tile job was done to code and even went above and beyond to fix some other little touch ups around the main floor without me even asking him to...I’ve lived here 4 years at this point, they owed me nothing.

Needless to say, if you decide to build a new home, you can trust fusion. They will support their work, which is the most important thing at the end of the day with all the uncertainty that comes with building homes and the trades they use and the weather it gets built in, etc. It may take them a little bit of time but they get it done and done right without cutting corners.

Thank you Adam Hummel, Alyssia Bezzina  Adam Hewlett and Kevin.",POSITIVE,0.9973304271697998

Well-deserved special mentions are offered to the pre and post-occupancy deficiencies team of John, Derrick and Chris specifically for their thorough and knowledgeable pre-delivery inspections, outstanding customer care and tremendous workmanship throughout the first year warranty period. Due to a seemingly high rate of turnover in personnel, the organization appears to be struggling with customer service attentiveness, response times, consistency, and follow through. Perhaps most troubling to the 389 Metalworks unit owners and residents is (after purchasing each respective unit from this developer in good faith) the prospect of being burdened with a significant financial cost to repair work that the developer, planners, builder, related contractors, etc. should have executed properly in the first place but (as of this writing) have yet to demonstrate accountability.",NEGATIVE,0.9998779296875

And here I am after 4.5 years of purchasing 2 homes from this company. Here are the problems I see since I am tearing apart all interior for upgrades.

Please note I did not get any interior upgrades hence I had carpets and one room being maple hardwood (upgrades were way overpriced)

1. Sub flooring all soaked in water when building the house then edges being grind off on the side

2. 30% Sub floor screws arent even screwed into the stud (causing squeaking sounds, few pieces of the sub floor isn’t even joint properly too)

3. Dry wall corner tape isn’t done at a 90 degree angle and it’s visable after a years..

4. Minor Foundation cracks in basement.

5. The hardwood floor in living room doesn’t have enough nails therefore it all cracked after 1.5 years

We can hear entire conversations, TV shows, the sink running and even the upstairs owners using the bathroom. If our neighbours have friends over its nearly impossible to sleep because it sounds like they’re right next to me.

When I contacted fusion homes about this I was told the unit met the provincial standard and that “some people are more sensitive to sound than others”. I guess some people don’t mind listing to someone urinate while they try and go to sleep.

Every time John completes work in my unit, it looks significantly better than it did before (everything being so clean and detailed).

You cannot get past an entry level customer service representative (which we have gone through 3, whether some quit or seen the poor service they offer) which we documented the damage with pictures and forwarded to the Fusion Home the representative.

They would send their ace handyman Ken, who put clear caulking over mortar joints, put a block of wood under a door sill to support it, sitting in water if it rained or snowed, and used a fine spray to find the problem.  He would not take any advice and a high school student would have did a better job and known you don't caulk mortar joints.

Not once did they come when the water was running through the gyproc in the garage.  Most of the time they stated they had other emergencies and we would not see them for weeks. Nor did we hear from a higher authority.

They replaced the door three times, did the deck membrane several times but never solved the problem.
Winmar assessed the situation atleast ten month ago and only completed the job recently after stating it would be completed in March.
Missed out on selling due to the work not being complete.
Fusion has not come close to there mission statement, you cannot speak to anyone but the entry level representative.
Would have been nice to hear from someone in the ivory tower as I am sure they would not have been impressed with the quality or service if they were in my situation.

Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Vaidehi,2,"I have had a poor customer service experience with Fusion Homes from the start since before I moved into my unit. They delayed the occupancy date which resulted in me having to extend my stay at another location, and then were not accommodating when I requested the same from them. Given the strains everyone is facing due to COVID, you would think that a big, well known developer such as Fusion Homes would make more of an effort to accommodate it's customers who have already paid deposits. Fusion Homes also talks about being sustainable and environmentally conscious, but have no provision for segregation and pick-up of recyclables within their community. I understand that these issues fall under a property manager for condos and townhouses, however, as of now, Fusion Homes is still the owner of the property and should take more responsibility for proper waste management, at least the bare minimum of having recyclables picked up. Fusion Homes has also delayed several of my 30-day Tarion items which even to date (10 months after move-in) have not yet been completed.  There are several more issues I faced throughout the past few months, but the most taxing has been the fact that they have significantly delayed the registration of our units and therefore, we are still paying Fusion Homes a monthly rental and maintenance fees when the homeowners should've been paying their mortgages instead. The delay in the registration of the units has resulted in significant financial burden and while it was supposed to be 60-90 days max for the final closing of the properties, it is now over 300 days (i.e., 10 months instead of 3). And there is still no indication of final closing dates. All this time, homeowners who have already paid a down payment are paying rent on their own supposed houses, instead of paying down their mortgages. Overall I have been extremely disappointed with Fusion Homes and their serious lack of customer service and major delays (well overdue) in completing outstanding work in my unit, let alone making the slightest gesture of good will towards their customers.",NEGATIVE,0.9999885559082031

Not really sure why there are so many ""bad"" reviews but after dealing with other builders in the past, fusion was by far in a league of their own! The entire experience has been pleasant and they have gone above and beyond several times.  We have lived in our home for over 2.5 years now and the quality of the build (being a contractor myself) is excellent for a large scale builder. We have purchased homes from other builders in the past and I couldn't believe how some of them considered the ""quality"" of the craftmanship acceptable, even by a long stretch. I know I may have higher standards than most, but when my wife can pick out things that are clearly unacceptable, it tells you something...denial is never a good look for any company especially when they don't do the right thing to fix it! With Fusion, it has been amazing from start to finish. We have great neighbours and we love our neighbourhood (we bought in chilico). Our neighbours have all had a great experience as well, which personally tells me that most of their customers are actually happy and there are always the select few who just can't be satisfied and happy customer generally don't say anything! I only write reviews on companies that deserve one, good or bad. The after service crew (granted there have been a few more appointments than originally anticipated) were professional and always cleaned up after themselves. At the end of it all, we are super happy with our home! We always get complimented on our ceiling (we upgraded the family room with a waffle ceiling) and our kitchen selection. We would definitely buy again from fusion when we are ready to move to the next house and we would strongly recommend them.

Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Tina G,5,"Denise assisted us at time of purchase, helping us choose our lot and was incredibly helpful. Pricing out potential upgrades and walking us through our first new construction home purchase before we officially signed made us feel comfortable committing knowing a rough idea on the total cost upfront. (I’ll add the 10% on top of the base is a fairly accurate based on what we ended up picking). Denise went through the contract at our pace which let us ask all the questions we wanted. And a few more over email after. I will add an additional review once we close in the coming months but wanted to share some feedback now on our upgrade process

When it came time to picking our preliminary and interior upgrades Brandy assisted us (along with Andrew). We did our research before hand to have a high level understanding of what we were looking for. I showed Brandy a picture from Pinterest and she helped us bring our vision to life. She is very good at what she does. We had our set budget for upgrades and she helped us work within it, we felt no pressure to choose anything. Brandy provided her suggestions and feedback when we requested her insight so we didn’t feel like we were being guided what to choose in any way. At the same time she did point out key things to be aware of (ie winter salt stains on black tiles, and exterior stones in the foyer on polished tiles likely wouldn’t be the best choice even though that’s what we were originally planning). She pointed out interesting changes that neighbours in the same model have done which was great! Overall she was great and an advocate for us when it came to more complex custom requests. There were a few hiccups after we missed a dimension after we signed the prelims but I truly believe Brandy was the one that vouched for us and helped us make our home perfect.

Thank you Denise for stage 1. Brandy for the upgrades. And Andrew for speeding up the appointment by pulling samples as we were talking.

We can’t wait to see how our new home come together and meet our neighbours!

If I was to share any feedback to fellow buyers it’s going into the upgrades have a good idea of what you want and your budget and work inside both. You will certainly find options if you have those two nailed down. If you have a tight budget ask to look at some of the interior upgrades during the preliminary stage so you know if you need to forego some of the preliminaries to get what you want in the interiors. I will mention they have a lot of great standard kitchen cabinet options.  We also poked around online at previous resale fusion homes looking to see the upgrades in a real home.

Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Nads Go,1,"Very Very bad experience with Fusion Homes regarding “Quick closing homes and Never miss a closing date”.
I picked a quick closing deal and signed back in August 2015. At the beginning the tentative closing date was in November and then later we were informed that it will be 21st of January 2016. To our surprise, this date turned out to be an occupancy date and not a closing date. Fusion Homes mentioned that it should only take a couple of months to get the papers through with the city of Guelph for closing. Unfortunately, until this date Fusion Homes team are not transparent enough to give a definite closing date! Recently, we have received a letter through our lawyer that they expect the closing date to be within weeks, but no date mentioned or confirmed. The delays by Fusion Homes - whether it's due to construction, sales or processing papers - have cost us over $12,000 as rent and occupancy fees. Why should the buyer dealing with a very reputable construction company bear such a cost? When will the paperwork get resolved to start my mortgage payments?
I contacted Fusion Homes on several occasions to get answers and finally asked to talk to a higher Manager, no one contacted me since then and the whole issue has been poorly handled so far!!!
The only answer I received from Fusion Homes that they are in a hurry just like me to close the deal and it’s of common interest to close the deal ASAP. It might be of common interest to close the deal ASAP but the buyer, in this case - me - is the most affected by these delays caused by Fusion Homes!!! I should have started paying my mortgage 6 months ago instead of paying occupancy fees to Fusion Homes.
This quote is listed as one of Fusion Homes Values: “Do or Do not: At Fusion Homes, there is no try. We have a bias for real action. We are never passive; instead we hold ourselves responsible and accountable to seeing each and every thing we start through to its conclusion.” We request Fusion Homes to stand up for their delays and bear some of the expenses incurred.

I never had such a horrible experience in my life, and I have bought houses from builders such as empire and cook home; they were amazing and way cheaper then the house that fusion homes sold me. The house was essentially unfinished when we got possession of it. The biggest reason that I considered the house unfinished was because when we moved in, we found two big holes in our living room. It turns out that they forgot to put in the electric outlets that were suppose to cover the holes. The other problem we had, and we still do, is that it takes a while to get hot water in the second floor, and we told them, their excuse was that the second floor is high up that is why it takes time to get hot water; that is one of the worst excuses considering appartments have alot of floors and they dont face this problem. The other problem was that the dishwasher space was not standardized, so we weren't able to fit our dishwasher. These were just a few problems in the house, there are many more and some are serious too. It has been four months since we moved in and they have yet to fix most of the problems with the house. The other problem is that the builder dont tell you everything. For example, we booked the plot in February and we only had two choices which were alright compared to the other ones. When we moved in, the the builder was still building houses around our house and the locations were way better than ours. The reason I bring this up is because these houses were build after our house, yet when we were booking our plots we did not get these choices as they were taken; this is odd and whenever we bring this topic up with the builder, they usually tend to ignore it. Another thing I would like to talk about is that we requested them to delay the possession date because our children were in school, and we couldnt move due to us living far away from the house we bought; so, they declined our request and we had to pay for a month for eventhough we weren't living there, and when we moved in the house it was unfinished. This builder is unprofessional and I would never recommend this builder. This is the worse experience in my life. I paid around 700k for this house expecting to get a home, but I cant even call this a home because of how unfinished it is.",NEGATIVE,0.9999949932098389

I noticed in that unit a really sloppy work with their deck looks like someone was in a hurry, I wonder if there is any process in place to protect these owners from poor workmanship. I am not sure if the owners know, I knocked their door to ask them but no answer, I will visit again.

Longwood Building Corporation,ChIJc3hN1S8QzkwR6Cw2aVsN90o,Stephanie Dube,1,"TLDR: DO NOT BUY A LONGWOOD HOME!

Longwood Builders have made first time home buying a nightmare! I do not recommend them.

Unknowledgeable: The sales representative at the time (she no longer works there) was extremely unknowledgeable. Not only did she not know the answers to many questions she didn’t offer to find out. In some cases she simply answered that my requests were not possible, come to find out they were! For example, I wanted a country style/apron front sink for the kitchen. When I inquired about it she told me that this option was not possible. I later found out that it was possible and that it was too late to change my selection. I also specifically mentioned the style of vanity I was installing, showed pictures, and that it required the plumbing to come from the wall as it would be “floating” and I did not want the pipes to be visible. Months later during a framing inspection I noticed that this was not reflected. I requested to have this fixed and was told it was too late. It would’ve been so much easier to have repaired, but no, we had to stick to Longwood’s timelines despite this being their error. I was also told I should have made the sales representative write it down. I found this extremely rude as it is not my responsibility to ensure that she’s competent at her job.

Unhelpful: The customer service after you’ve received your keys is non-existent. A PDI is performed but is almost useless because it is now 10 months later and I still have items on the list that are unresolved. I also submitted my 30 day form which the builder had until the end of November to address and I still have numerous items outstanding. Some of these items include severely cracked grout in the main bathroom shower, rendering the shower unusable due to possible water leakage. I also went 6 months with no cabinet doors above my fridge. The correct ones were there during the PDI, and then when I moved in the next day they were no longer there! I also have the wrong cabinet doors above the sink. My fireplace didn’t work during the PDI and it took 5 months to have someone come repair it. I had to follow up with the Longwood customer service about it, and when I did they replied that they forgot about it.

Slow: Longwood has failed to meet the guidelines set by Tarion for the builder repair period and have blamed it on COVID-19. They’ve stated that they have not been able to get trades people to come in and perform the repairs. Not once have they communicated with me that there would be delays, or have kept me updated with the status of the repairs. While I understand that COVID-19 has impacted many individuals, it is unfair to miss deadlines without communicating it to the customer. I found this extremely frustrating given their unwillingness to make accommodations to deadlines due to their errors (kitchen sink, plumbing). I found this also especially annoying as I booked a conciliation appointment for Tarion to come and evaluate the outstanding items. I received a call from the Longwood inspector a week prior to the inspection requesting to have someone come and do the repairs. I can’t help but wonder how you can go 10 months without having someone available to come perform the repairs but you have someone a week before a conciliation inspection which will ultimately result in a fine to Longwood?

Rude: I had to visit the sales centre and while I was there I brought up the issue of the plumbing being incorrect and that had I known they wouldn’t change it as requested, I would’ve selected a different vanity. The sales rep (a different one) said that it’s not her job to find out about plumbing location, and that it’s a “coulda should woulda” situation. She was extremely rude and I left the appointment in tears.

I could go about how Longwood makes you feel insignificant but I’m afraid I’m just wasting my time because they won’t change and they don’t care. I hope that people take this as a warning! Whatever you do do not buy Longwood!",NEGATIVE,0.9999964237213135

Menkes Developments Ltd,ChIJnxQrv2MtK4gRNJ398yKdSIQ,Ivan Su,2,"Way too many fake positive reviews from individuals with only 1 review.

Here is an honest review:

We purchased a townhome from them several years ago and the initial experience dealing with someone not from sales was  atrocious.  It was the first time we ever had to pick materials for the finishes and upgrades for our new home and instead of helping, the “interior” designer at Menkes head office mocked us and was dismissive with our requests for help.  It was only until I brought in my interior designer friend that we could get some headway.

The PDI experience was a headache as they seemed to want us to rush through things so they didn’t have to fix much.  Even as we listed many items that needed to be addressed or repaired, some major deficiencies that were listed could not be fixed properly or at all ex: crooked bathtub wall; unaligned closet doors; scratched cabinets/countertops; missing corner protectors….

Menkes also installed their own property management on site and the quality of service was poor.  The woman in charge would only answer through email and not address any issues that were happening at the complex.  Too many contracts were arranged without consideration for the budget and many times landscaping and snow removal was either done poorly or not done at all.  Due to poor fiscal management, we even had to pay special assessments within the first couple of years.

Menkes homes are definitely built on the cheap and give a whole new meaning for “McHomes” or “McMansions”.  Menkes is only getting by through past reputation and their namesake and the fact that the real estate market is hot.",NEGATIVE,0.9999963045120239

Menkes Developments Ltd,ChIJnxQrv2MtK4gRNJ398yKdSIQ,Jack Gert,1,"Menkes doesn't like criticism of its Waterfront ""Innovation"" Centre building, so they decided to turn off commenting on all their youtube videos. Utterly despicable! Shame on you, Menkes, for your horrible, shady business practices.

This is what I posted on the video about the WIC, a quote from a prominent architectural critic (emphasis mine) :

Menkes is CLUELESS about people's desire to have something that looks innovative from the outside too. That should be a huge part of the program when you're sticking the word 'innovation' in the name of the place. Truly innovative companies are going to want that spirit to be telegraphed by the exterior of the building, as it will be their calling card, their first solid impression for many potential clients. While there's some attempt at juggling a few boxes into a whole on the Jarvis Quay side, (which is LAME, but at least it's something), I'd argue that the Queens Quay (north) side is the most important people's impressions of the building, and it's mostly UNDIFFERENTIATED AND RELENTLESS IN ITS UTTER BLANDNESS, like it were facing a backyard fence in a nondescript suburb: There isn't a hint that any thought other than ""WHAT'S THE CHEAPEST WALL WE CAN PUT UP HERE?"" was formulated during its design.

YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL ""where the door is"" on this building now. Now that the staircase is gone, now that the vaulted volume on the Jarvis Quay side is gone, there's NOTHING to draw anyone to a particular point in the facade (from what I've seen so far anyway) to draw first time visitors to a particular spot. JUST ANOTHER DOOR at ground level, which looks like any other cafe or shop door, WON'T CUT IT: a building this long needs to draw people to the main entry from when they first see the building from a couple hundred metres away. Again, the Queens Quay facade needs a focal point, not A BIG DRAB NOTHING.

Just redesign the building, if for no other reason than to spare yourself further criticism and scorn.",NEGATIVE,0.9999790191650391

Toronto Deck and Railing,ChIJYVKqHjVDK4gROjcc35elmrw,Gerard Vaz,4,"Working with the team at Toronto Deck and Rail was a good experience. The final product was done to our satisfaction and the customer service was good from initial contact through to their techs. I took away one star because I think a couple of things could have been handled better:

1. Measurements are sent by the customer and then transcribed by customer service, this is not a problem unless you are getting glass panels which need to be custom cut. From the initial impression,  it was not clear that a follow up visit would be required to install the glass panels (one-two weeks after the railings were installed).

2. The post bases do not come with a cover for the base plate/ bolts. Although not a big deal, per se, they leave the railings with a bit of an unfinished look. I’m told that several customers have provided this feedback so the company is planning to include them in future designs. This would have been nice to know ahead of time.

Note, the base bolts do not come in the colour of the railings, which draws even more attention to them. I requested the techs paint the bolts before leaving, to which they obliged.

I’ve attached some photos to give prospective customers a reference.

Kamar was able to schedule the job within days of our initial contact.  He & his team arrived at the advised time, and the job was completed quickly and professionally.

I was particularly impressed with their solution to solve the problem of a broken step at the bottom of my porch; they installed the railing with an extension over the broken area, providing a safe hand support while maintaining the structural strength of the railing itself.

Tridel Head Office,ChIJvR6GO-AtK4gR3yxdWCwSoKM,Rahul Maingi,1,"Tridel's Disheartening Experience: A Buyer's Regret

I find myself compelled to share my experience with Tridel, and I must admit, it's left me deeply disheartened. Unlike my seamless dealings with developers such as Mattamy, Centre Court, and Pure Plaza, Tridel's customer service has been a letdown.

Taking occupancy at The Well in downtown Toronto on August 2, 2023, I encountered many unexpected hurdles. To rent out my suite during interim occupancy, everyone is obliged to engage their in-house leasing company, Del Condominiums Realty. Just so everyone knows they charge the first month's rent and an ongoing 6% fee of the monthly rent. Whereas, with other developers you are free to rent out the unit either yourself or hire a 3rd party company that you want to go with. But with Tridel properties you have to go with their in-house team, so you are bound to them, so with Tridel their is less flexibility.

Regrettably, my journey with Tridel has presented several challenges:

1. Title Transfer Turmoil: Tridel's insistence on approval from their exclusive list of lenders felt restrictive and arbitrary. As a self-employed individual, this requirement posed unnecessary complications. Unlike other developers, Tridel's rigidity in this matter left me feeling powerless.

2. Rental Roadblocks with Del Condominiums Realty:

•Their attribution of rental difficulties to a ""difficult market"" contradicts the experiences of others in the same scenario. When one pays for a service, it is reasonable to expect tangible results, not just excuses. (Till Date, they have NOT been able to rent out my unit, which in return is costing me thousands of dollars monthly)

•During the design process, I followed their specialist's advice to install an island, incurring an additional expense. Now, Tridel cites it as an issue. This inconsistency in their stance is both perplexing and frustrating.

•My persistent efforts to seek updates on my unit's status have been met with silence. Calls, texts, emails - all seemingly disregarded. This lack of responsiveness is disheartening, especially considering the fees involved.

3. Lack of Cohesion and Accountability: Tridel's internal teams appear disconnected, operating in silos. Coordination between sales, customer service, and Del Condominiums Realty is evidently lacking. This lack of cohesion has left me feeling isolated and disheartened.

In all honesty, I find myself in a state of helplessness. Tridel's policies and practices have left me feeling trapped and undervalued as a customer. I share this account not as a mere critique, but as a plea to potential buyers to exercise caution. While Tridel may boast a reputable name, the absence of genuine concern for customer concerns is a glaring shortcoming.

Its been about 3 weeks and nobody from Del Reality Team, Sales team and Customer Service Team at Tridel has provided me with any concrete answer to my questions. The entire organization has been bouncing me back and forth in between each other.

There is zero accountability with anyone at this organization.",NEGATIVE,0.9999336004257202
Tridel Head Office,ChIJvR6GO-AtK4gR3yxdWCwSoKM,Sandi Alexis,2,Tridel built my condo 3.5 years ago and mostly a good product but to save a few dimes on adhesives many mirrors have fallen off the walls and kitchen sinks have dropped by an inch.   Of course this is now out of warranty.   Do your clients a favour and spend the dimes for long-holding adhesives!!

Tridel Head Office,ChIJvR6GO-AtK4gR3yxdWCwSoKM,YANG SHEN,1,"On Aug 14, we got our keys for our new condo unit at Alto and Parkside.

Along with our agent from rental team, we inspected the room and found out the pipe of the dryer was totally broken. The pipe was broken before we moved in. Since we had booked the Elevator, and moving company, the agent convinced us to continue with the key handover process and move in on the next day. Meanwhile, he put this broken pipe issue in the inspection form and asked us to report this it to the maintenance team.

Aug 15 was our move-in day. We reported this issue to app.delrentals.com on Aug 16. We were assigned a maintenance person on Aug 24. (Yes 10 days later) The person can barely understand English. After several rounds of tough communication(basically some vocabularies connected by body language), he told us he didn't know it was the pipe issue. He needs to apply a new one from his company. He also promised that we would get a follow-up in 2 business days.

More than half a month has been passed since our first report of this issue. Still, we cannot use the dryer. We don't know why a simple pipe replacement could end up like this. We don’t even bother to mention the broken bulbs or countertop.

Anyhow, we submitted an other maintenance request and also an email to follow up the broken dryer. But as expected, no one answers.

I understand customer services is not your priority unless it effects your sales and business. But I think left a common on Del management’s google page is waste of time. So, that’s why you see my words here.

Also, do you guys know if Del management team still hiring? I haven’t seen a nice job like this for years. Nowadays, every industry is becoming more transparent, it’s difficult to find a job just take salary with doing nothing.

This is beyond disappointed. Honestly, I feel kinda funny right now. I know this is not gonna help me solve the issue, I still need to dry my clothes on my balcony under the sunshine for a while until winter is coming. So, I’ll probably call someone from other companies to come and fix the issue for Del rental management. However, at least other people can see and find a good job opportunity in your company. Who knows. Have a nice day.",NEGATIVE,0.9999769926071167

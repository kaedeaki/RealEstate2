Installers and electricians ready to go. As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!  \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Installers and electricians ready to go. As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them   \n","2                                                            We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions.

The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.  Kudos all round.   \n","...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ...   \n","139575                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           NaN   \n","139576                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           NaN   \n","139577                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Extremely reliable and trustworthy!

I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate.

     1Click Heating & Cooling were a decent company to work with.  They took care of all details of an electrical upgrade and central heat pump installation.  Work was performed on time when the schedule was determined.\\n\\nThe equipment they used was good equipment for the services provided, they did not cheap out on anything.\\n\\n1Click also are very willing to help with information on the rebates.\\n\\nOnly criticism of 1Click was their initial pricing and final pricing.  From the initial pricing, there was a number of changes with the final price.  I suggest getting a firm quote up front.   \n","51      First off, I want to say that the contracted installers were amazing, and the staff I worked with were absolutely phenomenal, but...\\nWhen working with them to gather info on what was being installed, I was sent a link to a brochure, and used that brochure to make a judgment call to move forward with the install. After the install was done, the model of the indoor units sent in the brochure were different than the units installed, and were missing features I thought would be included. Note that this was an error on the sales rep side, not the installer. They installed exactly what was expected to be installed by the work order.\\nNow, I work in customer service, and I know misunderstandings happen, and our sales rep did all the things I would expect and escalated the concern (again, although frustrated, still doing what I'd expect them to do). But then I got to the owner, and had thought we had come to a pretty reasonable compromise.\\nThe units all work great, but we need the WiFi component to manage the house while we are away and integrate it to our smart home setup. The brochure said Wifi Enabled, so we expected it to be Wifi enabled, but they weren't. In talking with the owner we deciphered all of the confusion and we had agreed to split the cost to add the wifi modules, and he would contact me back in a few days to confirm cost. I even offered to install it myself so they wouldn't need to pay labour costs for it.\\nIt's been a week after we talked, and despite calling and leaving voicemails, I haven't gotten anything back from him about this, and right or wrong, I paid for the install they did despite this misunderstanding still working to be resolved. I'm now working to find modules on my own to give the functionality I expected since the owner has gone silent.\\nThe short version of all this is to be sure to do extra research and question everything. I'm still really happy with the Heat Pumps, but disappointed in how the last bit of this came to be. This is the first major renovation we wanted for our first home we just bought, and refusing to let this ruin that milestone. Just be sure to triple check the info recieved with the installer so you are getting what you expect   \n","174

update my review of 1st choice home solutions and change the star rating. I still maintain that the installation could have been done a lot better. This update is mostly because of the excellent post installation response and repair of a leak that was discovered near the chimney. Glen had his guys over twice (within a day of calling) and repaired the flashing around the chimney. No more leaks (fingers crossed).\\n\\nWe signed a contract with 1st Choice home solutions to replace our roof in June 2019 and this time around the experience has been a lot different compared to 2016. Communication and organisation on their side is sub par. Have delayed the roof installation twice and all I hear is excuses. This used to be a good company. Not sure what is going on. Not the same company I dealt with in 2016.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\nWe have been in our home for 20 years now and have had some experience with contractors, some good and some bad. Glen and his team have been just about the most professional we have ever had the pleasure to work with. We had all our windows replaced with new Wardco vinyl windows. These were by far the best windows we were quoted. Great quality at a reasonable price. We even got a glass upgrade for better energy efficiency. The installation happened on the day that we booked (why can't all contractors show up when they say they will) and the installation team was amazing. Quick, efficient, clean and professional. They installed 17 windows in one day and cleaned up nicely after themselves. The capping was just superb. No more painting for me. They even inspected all windows to make sure they open and close with no problems and answered all our questions. Great experience.

It is almost 2100 sq ft.  Their standard options in cabinetry, tiles, countertop and carpeting are pretty good.  I only wish the windows were of better quality.  I love the wall to wall carpeting we chose for the home. But whoever installed the carpet did not do a good job. The floor plan is good on the top floor.  The ground floor plan could be better. The supposed family-room adjoining the kitchen is more suitable as a dining room.  The kitchen size is good.    At first it was a bit of a challenge to furnish the house as all the sizes and dimensions are non-standard.  overall I do like the house we bought.   \n","139458                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We bought a high castle home in Brampton...very first home...however...we were not fully satisfied...since there were some issues...which they had to resolve. We sold in 2008 ...down year...and lost monies...since then we moved on...but initial home buying experience...did not go well.   \n","139497                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     NaN   \n","139515                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              They have great designs and layouts for the homes.

After the install was done, the model of the indoor units sent in the brochure were different than the units installed, and were missing features I thought would be included. Note that this was an error on the sales rep side, not the installer. They installed exactly what was expected to be installed by the work order.\\nNow, I work in customer service, and I know misunderstandings happen, and our sales rep did all the things I would expect and escalated the concern (again, although frustrated, still doing what I'd expect them to do). But then I got to the owner, and had thought we had come to a pretty reasonable compromise.\\nThe units all work great, but we need the WiFi component to manage the house while we are away and integrate it to our smart home setup. The brochure said Wifi Enabled, so we expected it to be Wifi enabled, but they weren't. In talking with the owner we deciphered all of the confusion and we had agreed to split the cost to add the wifi modules, and he would contact me back in a few days to confirm cost. I even offered to install it myself so they wouldn't need to pay labour costs for it.\\nIt's been a week after we talked, and despite calling and leaving voicemails, I haven't gotten anything back from him about this, and right or wrong, I paid for the install they did despite this misunderstanding still working to be resolved. I'm now working to find modules on my own to give the functionality I expected since the owner has gone silent.\\nThe short version of all this is to be sure to do extra research and question everything. I'm still really happy with the Heat Pumps, but disappointed in how the last bit of this came to be. This is the first major renovation we wanted for our first home we just bought, and refusing to let this ruin that milestone.

I still maintain that the installation could have been done a lot better. This update is mostly because of the excellent post installation response and repair of a leak that was discovered near the chimney. Glen had his guys over twice (within a day of calling) and repaired the flashing around the chimney. No more leaks (fingers crossed).\\n\\nWe signed a contract with 1st Choice home solutions to replace our roof in June 2019 and this time around the experience has been a lot different compared to 2016. Communication and organisation on their side is sub par. Have delayed the roof installation twice and all I hear is excuses. This used to be a good company. Not sure what is going on. Not the same company I dealt with in 2016.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\nWe have been in our home for 20 years now and have had some experience with contractors, some good and some bad. Glen and his team have been just about the most professional we have ever had the pleasure to work with. We had all our windows replaced with new Wardco vinyl windows. These were by far the best windows we were quoted. Great quality at a reasonable price. We even got a glass upgrade for better energy efficiency. The installation happened on the day that we booked (why can't all contractors show up when they say they will) and the installation team was amazing. Quick, efficient, clean and professional. They installed 17 windows in one day and cleaned up nicely after themselves. The capping was just superb. No more painting for me. They even inspected all windows to make sure they open and close with no problems and answered all our questions. Great experience.

I love the wall to wall carpeting we chose for the home. But whoever installed the carpet did not do a good job. The floor plan is good on the top floor.  The ground floor plan could be better. The supposed family-room adjoining the kitchen is more suitable as a dining room.  The kitchen size is good.

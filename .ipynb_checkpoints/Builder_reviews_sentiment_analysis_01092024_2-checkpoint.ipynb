Our experience with them was great, and we wanted to share our story with Activa.\\n\\nWhen we were chosen to purchase a house from Activa, we were excited as it was very competitive. Dave, who was the representative , was able to help us through the process before design studio.\\n\\nAfter we chose our lot and went through structural upgrades with Dave, we went to design studio to choose designs and trims that go into our house. Maggie was our designer. She was very professional and friendly to work with. We were a picky customer and we changed our choices a lot, but she was very nice and understanding. She also suggested us a lot in terms of choosing. Now our home looks amazing thanks to her.\\n\\nWhen we were done with choices, Tammy was able to take care of all the questions we had. I think that building a home with a builder can arise many questions because it is a complex process and some things can be hard to understand. We just had to email Tammy and she was able to answer every question, which gave us a peace of mind.\\n\\nAfter the home was built and when we were going through warranty process (before closing, after closing), Scott and his team acted quick and worked in a very professional matter. They were paying attention to small details and we were able to correct and fix most of the issues we were able to find. Quality of the build went up higher after we went through home with Scott.\\n\\nThe whole process of purchasing a house from Activa was easier than what we expected and they were very professional. We would recommend Activa to any buyers who are willing to purchase a house from builder. Activa will get you a great quality home with less headaches you have to get. We appreciate Activa’s professionalism, and for a great house.</td>\n",

The overall experience and process was smooth and well dealt with in spite of challenges posed due to COVID restrictions. They were all with us during the design to building stage and responded to each query and issues promptly and efficiently. They made us feel like family and always solved our issues however tiny or complex they were and ensured timely delivery. Staff is very friendly and top notch. Post delivery service was on point and it was a thorough professional engagement throughout. Kudos to team Activa and all the best for all their future projects.

Our experience with them was great, and we wanted to share our story with Activa.\\n\\nWhen we were chosen to purchase a house from Activa, we were excited as it was very competitive. Dave, who was the representative , was able to help us through the process before design studio.\\n\\nAfter we chose our lot and went through structural upgrades with Dave, we went to design studio to choose designs and trims that go into our house. Maggie was our designer. She was very professional and friendly to work with. We were a picky customer and we changed our choices a lot, but she was very nice and understanding. She also suggested us a lot in terms of choosing. Now our home looks amazing thanks to her.\\n\\nWhen we were done with choices, Tammy was able to take care of all the questions we had. I think that building a home with a builder can arise many questions because it is a complex process and some things can be hard to understand. We just had to email Tammy and she was able to answer every question, which gave us a peace of mind.\\n\\nAfter the home was built and when we were going through warranty process (before closing, after closing), Scott and his team acted quick and worked in a very professional matter. They were paying attention to small details and we were able to correct and fix most of the issues we were able to find. Quality of the build went up higher after we went through home with Scott.\\n\\nThe whole process of purchasing a house from Activa was easier than what we expected and they were very professional. We would recommend Activa to any buyers who are willing to purchase a house from builder. Activa will get you a great quality home with less headaches you have to get. We appreciate Activa’s professionalism, and for a great house.  "

The overall experience and process was smooth and well dealt with in spite of challenges posed due to COVID restrictions. They were all with us during the design to building stage and responded to each query and issues promptly and efficiently. They made us feel like family and always solved our issues however tiny or complex they were and ensured timely delivery. Staff is very friendly and top notch. Post delivery service was on point and it was a thorough professional engagement throughout. Kudos to team Activa and all the best for all their future projects. They do not just build homes rather they build Dream Homes..!!   \n",

I closed my property with them couple weeks ago … Had they not accommodated the on-time closing of my unit, I would have risked losing my pre-approved mortgage (2.5%) that was offered to me two years ago.\\n\\nActiva's entire staff has been very supportive and pleasant to work with… Megan, Jen , Jessica and Others … Thank you all.\\n\\nThink buying a home in K-W Region, Think Activa…   \n",

       "4    We purchased our home from Activa around 2022. Our experience with them was great, and we wanted to share our story with Activa.\\n\\nWhen we were chosen to purchase a house from Activa, we were excited as it was very competitive. Dave, who was the representative , was able to help us through the process before design studio.\\n\\nAfter we chose our lot and went through structural upgrades with Dave, we went to design studio to choose designs and trims that go into our house. Maggie was our designer. She was very professional and friendly to work with. We were a picky customer and we changed our choices a lot, but she was very nice and understanding. She also suggested us a lot in terms of choosing. Now our home looks amazing thanks to her.\\n\\nWhen we were done with choices, Tammy was able to take care of all the questions we had. I think that building a home with a builder can arise many questions because it is a complex process and some things can be hard to understand. We just had to email Tammy and she was able to answer every question, which gave us a peace of mind.\\n\\nAfter the home was built and when we were going through warranty process (before closing, after closing), Scott and his team acted quick and worked in a very professional matter. They were paying attention to small details and we were able to correct and fix most of the issues we were able to find. Quality of the build went up higher after we went through home with Scott.\\n\\nThe whole process of purchasing a house from Activa was easier than what we expected and they were very professional. We would recommend Activa to any buyers who are willing to purchase a house from builder. Activa will get you a great quality home with less headaches you have to get. We appreciate Activa’s professionalism, and for a great house.   \n",

Well-deserved special mentions are offered to the pre and post-occupancy deficiencies team of John, Derrick and Chris specifically for their thorough and knowledgeable pre-delivery inspections, outstanding customer care and tremendous workmanship throughout the first year warranty period. Due to a seemingly high rate of turnover in personnel, the organization appears to be struggling with customer service attentiveness, response times, consistency, and follow through. Perhaps most troubling to the 389 Metalworks unit owners and residents is (after purchasing each respective unit from this developer in good faith) the prospect of being burdened with a significant financial cost to repair work that the developer, planners, builder, related contractors, etc. should have executed properly in the first place but (as of this writing) have yet to demonstrate accountability.</td>\n",

They \"forgot\" about our 30 day so they had to do a rush job after the alloted time to fix the listed items.  Did a so-so job on it. Forced us to go through the conciliation process because they haven't fixed our one year items and have nothing scheduled to fix the issues... winter is coming and our outdoor item is still not resolved... I guess it's the same with every company once the cheque clears no one cares .  Sad I expected better from Activa.   \n",

       "274  Overall, our new home purchase at the Metalworks community has offered a reasonably positive customer experience, yet has included negative elements that leave us unsure of any intention to purchase from this builder at a future development. Well-deserved special mentions are offered to the pre and post-occupancy deficiencies team of John, Derrick and Chris specifically for their thorough and knowledgeable pre-delivery inspections, outstanding customer care and tremendous workmanship throughout the first year warranty period. Due to a seemingly high rate of turnover in personnel, the organization appears to be struggling with customer service attentiveness, response times, consistency, and follow through. Perhaps most troubling to the 389 Metalworks unit owners and residents is (after purchasing each respective unit from this developer in good faith) the prospect of being burdened with a significant financial cost to repair work that the developer, planners, builder, related contractors, etc. should have executed properly in the first place but (as of this writing) have yet to demonstrate accountability.   \n",

New home buyers please be aware of these pre occupancy fees and difference between pre occupancy and final closing dates which will not be disclosed at the time of pre booking.\\nBut similar townhomes from other builders are getting registered within a month or sooner after pre occupancy not sure why fusion is different.   \n",

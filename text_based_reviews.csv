Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Galina Khavrenko,5,"We've been a client of Activa Homes for about 5+ years. The quality and design options Activa provides are absolutely amazing. The design and customer care team are always one call away. The Homeowner Orientation, especially for first-time buyers, is very educating. I'm happy to be an Activa homeowner."
Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Sandesh Vijay,5,"They build terrific homes in wonderful communities. A top notch builder in the K-W region.

I’ll forever be grateful to their customer service and construction team. I closed my property with them couple weeks ago … Had they not accommodated the on-time closing of my unit, I would have risked losing my pre-approved mortgage (2.5%) that was offered to me two years ago.

Activa's entire staff has been very supportive and pleasant to work with… Megan, Jen , Jessica and Others … Thank you all.

Think buying a home in K-W Region, Think Activa…"
Activa,ChIJxbIbrsrzK4gRyKBqOoYlX6k,Ko Hyunjun,5,"We purchased our home from Activa around 2022. Our experience with them was great, and we wanted to share our story with Activa.

When we were chosen to purchase a house from Activa, we were excited as it was very competitive. Dave, who was the representative , was able to help us through the process before design studio.

After we chose our lot and went through structural upgrades with Dave, we went to design studio to choose designs and trims that go into our house. Maggie was our designer. She was very professional and friendly to work with. We were a picky customer and we changed our choices a lot, but she was very nice and understanding. She also suggested us a lot in terms of choosing. Now our home looks amazing thanks to her.

When we were done with choices, Tammy was able to take care of all the questions we had. I think that building a home with a builder can arise many questions because it is a complex process and some things can be hard to understand. We just had to email Tammy and she was able to answer every question, which gave us a peace of mind.

After the home was built and when we were going through warranty process (before closing, after closing), Scott and his team acted quick and worked in a very professional matter. They were paying attention to small details and we were able to correct and fix most of the issues we were able to find. Quality of the build went up higher after we went through home with Scott.

The whole process of purchasing a house from Activa was easier than what we expected and they were very professional. We would recommend Activa to any buyers who are willing to purchase a house from builder. Activa will get you a great quality home with less headaches you have to get. We appreciate Activa’s professionalism, and for a great house."
Alma Mechanical,ChIJJ5_TX-IA1YkR6nZEdM6l0Sc,Ron Provost,1,Called today - Their name and number all over furnace from when they installed. Furnace down - No heat. Left message - 53 minutes later return call - First thing!!!!!! out of persons mouth is - They are far away and not a warranty item - Which I already checked - Its a covered item - Its 9 yrs old - the items is covered for 20 years - Said they wouldn't come here for repair  (even though they installed it) - Absolutely terrible way to do business! - My next call is to the builder to not use these people. - Then Lennox -
Alma Mechanical,ChIJJ5_TX-IA1YkR6nZEdM6l0Sc,Lisa Waldinsperger,5,"Alma did an amazing job installing my new furnace! My old furnace was shut down suddenly and we were experiencing an ""extreme cold weather"" alert in our area.  Alma was at my house and had the furnace installed within hours on the same day! The installers were professional and positive, respectful of my home and helpful with information and letting me know what was happening.  The office staff were equally wonderful to work with and of course, I love my new Lennox furnace...it's so quiet and runs like a charm! Thank you, Alma, for doing a great job and caring about your customer! I highly recommend Alma to everyone!"
Alma Mechanical,ChIJJ5_TX-IA1YkR6nZEdM6l0Sc,Nick Lawson,1,"Customer for 10 years  have had service in the past.  Recently called for info on a warning light on the furnace and they said they couldn't help me and directed me elsewhere.  Tried to return a brand new furnace filter over $40 value, again after buying them twice yearly for 10 years  and Shane tells me they don't have a return policy.  So $800 worth of filters I buy, but when I need to return one extra I purchased they won't return it.  Poor business etiquette, definitely would not recommend them.  Customer service goes a long way, and here there is zero so why give them business."
CCR Build + Remodel,ChIJ-0bany_lLogRUBnpws5gzI4,Jodi Knight,5,"We've just completed a kitchen renovation with CCR.  The entire process was so well organized from the initial planning stage through to completion.  The site manager and office staff were extremely responsive and they, as well as all the sub-trades who worked on the project were knowledgeable, competent and always professional.
We would certainly recommend CCR to anyone considering a home renovation."
CCR Build + Remodel,ChIJ-0bany_lLogRUBnpws5gzI4,James L. Stouffer,5,"Dozens of contractors are available in the London area.  However, if you want the best for your build or remodel, you must use CCR.  Arne Madsen, the owner, is a terrific person with a keen eye for design and detail.  He has attracted a skilled group of employees and hires reliable sub trades. Their work is first rate plus and has been recognized with dozens of awards. CCR will do your job start-to-finish, from getting the building permit to completing final touches to your satisfaction.

We hired CCR to remove our old deck and build a new one. Because we have a walkout, the deck is 9 feet above the patio. The old deck was not covered. CCR extended the existing roof over the new deck. It is impossible to distinguish where the new roof connects to the existing roof, as it is a perfect piece of workmanship.   The ceiling finish on the deck is stylish as is the finish of the underside of the deck and the underside of the stairs both of which are finished with the same material as the existing soffit and fascia. Our neighbor, who has expertise in construction, informally followed the work and inspected the finished deck. He commented on the high quality of construction and attractiveness of the new deck. We are extremely pleased with the work done by CCR and are enjoying our new deck!"
CCR Build + Remodel,ChIJ-0bany_lLogRUBnpws5gzI4,Terry Hamilton,5,"We had a renovation of our kitchen, ensuite, and deck in 2022. It was a pleasure to work with the CCR team and contractors and subcontractors. We absolutely love our renovations and are grateful for Peder’s vision to enlarge our kitchen window and walk us through what our ensuite could entail!  Wow. What a difference!!  Special thanks to Ryan, Scott, Guerin, Erin, and Stewart, and especially to our interior designer, Jen!!  We couldn’t have got through this without all of you!!!  Your professionalism, dedication and attention to detail was above and beyond. We wholeheartedly recommend CCR to others who are contemplating a renovation.

Digreen Homes,ChIJ2yfX4tjU1IkRbct8G2DI2nA,S S,4,"We started off on a bad note with all the delays and miscommunication from the builder itself.  Sad the builder does not care or not even acknowledging emails.

As soon as Dawn and Warren came on board I can give them 5star as the communication has been so clear and no run arounds. Dawn and Warren really helped close loops and returned phone calls. They both have amazing customer service skills. Thank you!"
Digreen Homes,ChIJ2yfX4tjU1IkRbct8G2DI2nA,Harjeet bajwa,1,Worst builder ever to deal with.. we were supposed to get our house in August 2023 which we booked in 2021 on countryside and Torbram Brampton location but construction did not even start..they said they have dispute with city.. city said they were not even allowed to sell the lots before approval from city.. total fraud.. here we are stuck can’t even buy another house because they are not refunding our money.. stay away from this builder.they change their name for every new site.. total scam.. taking advantage of loopholes in the system..
Digreen Homes,ChIJ2yfX4tjU1IkRbct8G2DI2nA,Abhishek Tiwari,1,"Don't give your hard earn money to this builder, will take advantage of buyer's trust & walk away due broken system of Ontario, See the pictures of home delivered by builder, with nails on floor, no countertop, no mirror, no outlet for microwave, no garage door, unfinished stairs, no gravel etc etc - builder delivered home unfinished & not safe for kids, after one month of closing they don't reply email or want to finish the work they left."
Ecocor Construction,ChIJLeO7za44K4gRDb2YOuTLIO0,Ali Alzamil,5,"I don’t know where to begin, but I am very happy with my new kitchen and the customer service I was provided. They always kept me up to date with what is going on in my house. Highly recommended & very professional!"
Ecocor Construction,ChIJLeO7za44K4gRDb2YOuTLIO0,sarah kagan,5,"Ecocor Construction has recently completed a kitchen renovation at our home. The quality, service and professionalism is exceptional. I highly recommend this company. Rami truly loves what he does and every person on his team is fantastic and professional. Thank you!!!"
Ecocor Construction,ChIJLeO7za44K4gRDb2YOuTLIO0,Kim Nguyen,5,"We are so glad we hired Rami and his team to work on our kitchen and main floor.  We are very happy and satisfied with everything and we love our new kitchen!  Ecocor did an amazing job!  Our kitchen transformation was like day and night.  Everything was done exactly how we wanted and you stayed within our budget and nothing more.  Rami, you went above and beyond to give us what we wanted and what we needed.  We are very grateful for all the wonderful things you have done for us.  We enjoyed working with you and your team.  Everyone was friendly and had a great sense of humour.  Thank you for all the hard work and the excellent quality of work!  We would definitely recommend Ecocor Construction to our friends, family and neighbours."
Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Scott Lepold,5,"The Sales and Construction team(s) were excellent. Professional, detailed and skilled at what they do to deliver a quality product/home. Greg Langendyk and team were prompt, empathetic and went above and beyond throughout the construction process. My wife and I couldn't be happier with what was delivered. Thanks Fusion team!"
Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,palak patel,5,"I can't express enough how grateful I am for the incredible assistance I received from Brandy Lepold during our home building consultation. From the very beginning, we had many doubts about whether to move forward with Fusion Homes Company, but Brandy's guidance and support made all the difference.

She patiently answered all of our questions, alleviating our initial hesitation and ensuring that we had a clear understanding of the entire process. Brandy's knowledge and expertise were evident, and she went above and beyond to make sure we felt confident in our decision.

We are now excited to begin the journey of building our dream home with Fusion Homes, and we have Brandy to thank for that. Her continued support and dedication are exactly what we need as we move forward in this process. We feel like we are in capable hands, and that is a great comfort.

Thank you, Brandy, for making this experience so much smoother and for helping us turn our dream home into a reality. Your assistance has been invaluable, and we look forward to working with you and Fusion Home Company to see our vision come to life."
Fusion Homes,ChIJE1rXfZiEK4gReqaygRXkfKU,Sandra Swiet,2,"Beware of things that are “free” or “included “ with the purchase of your home as these items are done by contractors and the quality is poor (such as driveway, grass/levelling of ground). Example, this landing before our stairs has been fixed 3 times… it’s uneven and looks horrible. Customer Service is nice and respond quickly but the results from the end products is disappointing. The process exhausted me from escalating it anymore and simply accept this is the best it will be.

Deb McCarthy was our sales rep (the Glade) and she was wonderful, personable and helped us so much!! Unlike the current sales rep who isn’t very friendly.

Nick is absolutely amazing he’s kind and such a hard worker. Fusion Homes should be very grateful for such a wonderful employee.

In the end, it’s things like these steps that I have to look and use every day and be reminded of the fact that the sale is done and they’ve “fixed” the issue and hope I don’t follow up again…"
Gemini Homebuilders,ChIJoQanqtiPK4gRlLrGQlyonZI,christian bautista,5,"We love our new home in Inverhaugh, the team at Gemini have been a pleasure to work with. The quality, service and attention to detail is outstanding."
Gemini Homebuilders,ChIJoQanqtiPK4gRlLrGQlyonZI,David Stott,5,"My wife and I selected Gemini Homes (in Inverhaugh) as the design spec was exactly what we were looking for - luxury finish options in quality constructed bungalows with comfortably-sized property in a rural-but-accessible location.

The complete experience was excellent.  Monica was gracious and patient with our questions in the sale process. On the design side, we were limited only by our imagination, and Stacy and team were enthusiastic about working with our ideas.  Energy independence was important to us, and we had no issues bringing in a supplier for solar generation and storage. Brad was highly accommodating and responsive to email and helped with the numerous questions we had.

The home was completed exactly on schedule, and the construction and finishing quality is superb. I would highly recommend Gemini Homes and most definitely work with them again."
Gemini Homebuilders,ChIJoQanqtiPK4gRlLrGQlyonZI,Vanja G,5,"We recently purchased a townhome with Gemini , our experience has been great. The team is a pleasure to work with, knowledgeable, responsive and always helpful. We are in love with our townhome - great quality and design! Thanks Gemini!"
Great Gulf,ChIJk-aAJHXT1IkR162Fn2PZ_Xo,Ankita Zaveri,5,"I had one of the best experiences with Great Gulf. I consider myself lucky to have found them for my first home. Their service was nothing short of excellent. They took the time to explain every aspect of the process, making the entire journey smooth and transparent. Any concerns or questions were promptly answered. Any repairs required were also promptly done. - Shout out to Nick, Rhonda & Greg, Thank You so much for a wonderful experience!

The workmanship of the home they delivered is truly remarkable. From the foundation to the finishing touches, it's evident that Great Gulf is committed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship."
Great Gulf,ChIJk-aAJHXT1IkR162Fn2PZ_Xo,Lakshan Sri,5,Amazing homes. Great Builder with thought out designs and floorplans. Customer service was amazing as well!
Great Gulf,ChIJk-aAJHXT1IkR162Fn2PZ_Xo,Jesse Schulman,4,"Overall, our experience with great gulf was positive. We love our house and customer service has been very responsive to all our questions and concerns since moving into the home. The one feedback I would have was when upgrading to putting a conduit behind our TV to the side of the TV we were not informed or shown the pecs so we were not informed it would run to the basement which results in all TV wires having to run to the basement. Other than this, we have had a very pleasant experience and great gulf was a pleasure to work with to build our home."
Holman Construction Inc.,ChIJ00ISyOv7LogRxoLavOAzO9I,Garrett Pedlar,5,I can’t say enough good things about Scott and Kate and the Holman Construction crew! They built my bungalow home in 2022/2023 and couldn’t be happier with the final product and customer service and attention to detail! Scott and Kate treat every decision like it is their own home! Strongly recommend them to build your next dream home or large renovation.
Holman Construction Inc.,ChIJ00ISyOv7LogRxoLavOAzO9I,Robert Metcalfe,5,"“We were referred to Scott for completely renovating our beach house.  We worked with both him and Kate on flooring, colours, kitchen cabinets, but for most of the project, we simply left it up to Scott to do what he would do if he owned the home.  It made the process a lot less stressful for us, and we are sure we might the right choice.  As the project progressed and some other choices came up, he was always willing to do what was needed.  We were very pleased with the entire renovation, and all the work and help that Scott, Kate and their employees provided.  The entire team was a pleasure to work with.  I would strongly advise anyone who wants quality work, done by good people, to call Holman Construction Inc.  We are sure glad they were referred to us and very much appreciate all that they did!

Longwood Building Corporation,ChIJc3hN1S8QzkwR6Cw2aVsN90o,Dominique Mayer,5,"I have purchased 2 Longwood homes and we have been so happy with our purchases. They have always been professional and responsive. My home is just the way I wanted it.

The complaints on here talk about time it took to have things fixed but that’s just the process of things. Everything I had go through the proper process was fixed and were reasonable things to begin with. Do you research on buying new homes and what your home will go through in its first few years.

I would recommend buying a Longwood home!"
Longwood Building Corporation,ChIJc3hN1S8QzkwR6Cw2aVsN90o,sharan,5,"I had a great experience in buying new house from longwood. The whole process from booking the house and closing went very smoothly. I love the my new home. Especially I had great experience with Simon whissel who was very professional, responsive and considerate towards our concerns. Thank you"
Longwood Building Corporation,ChIJc3hN1S8QzkwR6Cw2aVsN90o,S,2,"We have been in our home for over 2yrs and have finally had almost all the items on our Tarion list complete.  Building a home during Covid was not a great experience but still not an excuse for some of the poor quality trades Longwood uses.

If you are not prepared to take time off work waiting for trades to not show up and then finally come to access (some came as many as 4 times for the same issue) and return without proper replacement parts just save your self the headache. We used weeks of vacation time to accommodate appointments and many hours of time in correspondence to get things done.

Many items on our list should have been completed prior to occupancy. Some items were major and took hours of emailing  up the chain to get results.  There were well over a 100 items on our PDI.

Positives are that we love the layout and location of our home."
Menkes Developments Ltd,ChIJnxQrv2MtK4gRNJ398yKdSIQ,Ryan Williams,4,"One of the better developers within the GTA. I was thinking of buying a place at Bravo when I first heard of project. When I went to the sales office, the reception staff greeted me with a welcoming smile. The sales rep called Estella was super duper respectful even though I came in without my agent since I want to take a look before committing. I just wanted to point out their Sale's team excellent services even though I was a pain to deal with. Cheers~"
Menkes Developments Ltd,ChIJnxQrv2MtK4gRNJ398yKdSIQ,Kelly Hernandez,5,"I purchased a Mobilio unit in 2019, and after residing in it for an extended period, I am delighted to share that the overall quality of my new home has surpassed all my expectations. From the beginning, I encountered a few minor issues before occupancy, but thanks to the outstanding support from their admin, Ling, my entire experience was transformed into an exceptional one. Her unparalleled dedication and willingness to go above and beyond to ensure everything was finalized before my move-in date were truly commendable."
Menkes Developments Ltd,ChIJnxQrv2MtK4gRNJ398yKdSIQ,F ily,1,"Horrible company to deal with if you are a tenant. This are the most greedy and unhelpful company, they will rip you off right and left with every chance they get. They show zero empathy for struggling but very loyal tenants and will give zero days of extension and put you right on default immediately."

Oke Woodsmith Building Systems Inc,ChIJQT_HCGU6L4gRRTp_-Zzcm9Q,David Fleming,5,"Oke Woodsmith did an excellent job renovating and upgrading our bathroom in Grand Bend. They also simultaneously installed hardwood floors throughout our second floor. They were pricey a little, but I didn't have to worry about scheduling plumbers, tilers, electricians etc...they managed these craftsmen expertly for me. Moreover, they provided welcome design features like offsetting subway tiles in our shower that look really sharp. For big jobs that require coordination and multiple skill sets, Oke Woodmith is they way to go in Lambton Shores!"

Toronto Deck and Railing,ChIJYVKqHjVDK4gROjcc35elmrw,Gerard Vaz,4,"Working with the team at Toronto Deck and Rail was a good experience. The final product was done to our satisfaction and the customer service was good from initial contact through to their techs. I took away one star because I think a couple of things could have been handled better:

1. Measurements are sent by the customer and then transcribed by customer service, this is not a problem unless you are getting glass panels which need to be custom cut. From the initial impression,  it was not clear that a follow up visit would be required to install the glass panels (one-two weeks after the railings were installed).

2. The post bases do not come with a cover for the base plate/ bolts. Although not a big deal, per se, they leave the railings with a bit of an unfinished look. I’m told that several customers have provided this feedback so the company is planning to include them in future designs. This would have been nice to know ahead of time.

Note, the base bolts do not come in the colour of the railings, which draws even more attention to them. I requested the techs paint the bolts before leaving, to which they obliged.

I’ve attached some photos to give prospective customers a reference.

Overall, I’m satisfied with my experience and end product."
Toronto Deck and Railing,ChIJYVKqHjVDK4gROjcc35elmrw,Gordon McGinn,5,"My old wrought-iron porch railing had corroded to the point of being unsafe, and required replacement urgently.

I contacted Toronto Deck & Railing, sent them some pictures for review, and they contacted me promptly for a discussion of alternatives and provided a detailed (and very competitive) quote for their services.

Kamar was able to schedule the job within days of our initial contact.  He & his team arrived at the advised time, and the job was completed quickly and professionally.

I was particularly impressed with their solution to solve the problem of a broken step at the bottom of my porch; they installed the railing with an extension over the broken area, providing a safe hand support while maintaining the structural strength of the railing itself.

The invoicing and payment process was easy and seamless; they have a secure on-line payment portal for quick settlement, and provide comprehensive invoices and receipts.

I was extremely satisfied with these folks, and would not hesitate to recommend them."
Toronto Deck and Railing,ChIJYVKqHjVDK4gROjcc35elmrw,Janice Forrester,5,I recently had new railings installed on my porch. It's beautiful and i really love it and I've received many compliments from my neighbors. Despite the rain my installer showed up and completed the installation within a few short hours. I recommend this company if you need new railings.
Tridel Head Office,ChIJvR6GO-AtK4gR3yxdWCwSoKM,Rahul Maingi,1,"Tridel's Disheartening Experience: A Buyer's Regret

I find myself compelled to share my experience with Tridel, and I must admit, it's left me deeply disheartened. Unlike my seamless dealings with developers such as Mattamy, Centre Court, and Pure Plaza, Tridel's customer service has been a letdown.

Taking occupancy at The Well in downtown Toronto on August 2, 2023, I encountered many unexpected hurdles. To rent out my suite during interim occupancy, everyone is obliged to engage their in-house leasing company, Del Condominiums Realty. Just so everyone knows they charge the first month's rent and an ongoing 6% fee of the monthly rent. Whereas, with other developers you are free to rent out the unit either yourself or hire a 3rd party company that you want to go with. But with Tridel properties you have to go with their in-house team, so you are bound to them, so with Tridel their is less flexibility.

Regrettably, my journey with Tridel has presented several challenges:

1. Title Transfer Turmoil: Tridel's insistence on approval from their exclusive list of lenders felt restrictive and arbitrary. As a self-employed individual, this requirement posed unnecessary complications. Unlike other developers, Tridel's rigidity in this matter left me feeling powerless.

2. Rental Roadblocks with Del Condominiums Realty:

•Their attribution of rental difficulties to a ""difficult market"" contradicts the experiences of others in the same scenario. When one pays for a service, it is reasonable to expect tangible results, not just excuses. (Till Date, they have NOT been able to rent out my unit, which in return is costing me thousands of dollars monthly)

•During the design process, I followed their specialist's advice to install an island, incurring an additional expense. Now, Tridel cites it as an issue. This inconsistency in their stance is both perplexing and frustrating.

•My persistent efforts to seek updates on my unit's status have been met with silence. Calls, texts, emails - all seemingly disregarded. This lack of responsiveness is disheartening, especially considering the fees involved.

3. Lack of Cohesion and Accountability: Tridel's internal teams appear disconnected, operating in silos. Coordination between sales, customer service, and Del Condominiums Realty is evidently lacking. This lack of cohesion has left me feeling isolated and disheartened.

In all honesty, I find myself in a state of helplessness. Tridel's policies and practices have left me feeling trapped and undervalued as a customer. I share this account not as a mere critique, but as a plea to potential buyers to exercise caution. While Tridel may boast a reputable name, the absence of genuine concern for customer concerns is a glaring shortcoming.

Its been about 3 weeks and nobody from Del Reality Team, Sales team and Customer Service Team at Tridel has provided me with any concrete answer to my questions. The entire organization has been bouncing me back and forth in between each other.

There is zero accountability with anyone at this organization."
Tridel Head Office,ChIJvR6GO-AtK4gR3yxdWCwSoKM,Sandi Alexis,2,Tridel built my condo 3.5 years ago and mostly a good product but to save a few dimes on adhesives many mirrors have fallen off the walls and kitchen sinks have dropped by an inch.   Of course this is now out of warranty.   Do your clients a favour and spend the dimes for long-holding adhesives!!  Truly inconsiderate when the overall price is considered.
Tridel Head Office,ChIJvR6GO-AtK4gR3yxdWCwSoKM,Thomas Mitchell,1,If I had a dollar for every time there was a key system failure in our brand new condo building then I would have enough money to move out and actually buy a house
Upper Canada Consultants,ChIJ7SRXQnZR04kRgjDSNxbEceE,Don Edkins,1,"If you're looking to be frustrated and never receive a return call/text/email, I highly recommend hiring this company.  Unfortunately their time is more valuable than yours, even if you've already paid for their services....."
Upper Canada Consultants,ChIJ7SRXQnZR04kRgjDSNxbEceE,Kelly,5,"We're putting in a pool this summer and the city had requested a Survey and Grading Plan in order to proceed with the Pool Permit.  I got in touch with Roberto and he was super helpful over the phone as well as e-mail.  He told me exactly what he needed, how much it was going to cost, gave me a timeline and was able to get us all of the final paperwork way quicker than we had originally anticipated.  He was pleasant to deal with and great with communication throughout the whole process.  An added bonuses was that everything we needed was much cheaper than I was anticipating.  I highly recommend Roberto and UCC for anyone looking for a professional, affordable, great-overall communication and experience regarding survey and grading plans for your pool permitting needs.  I will be sure to recommend to anyone needing this service moving forward.  Roberto and UCC will be my go-to if the opportunity arises where I need another survey in the future.  Thanks again for your great service!  It's greatly appreciated!"

The design and customer care team are always one call away. The Homeowner Orientation, especially for first-time buyers, is very educating. I'm happy to be an Activa homeowner.\n",

      "\n",
      "When we were chosen to purchase a house from Activa, we were excited as it was very competitive. Dave, who was the representative , was able to help us through the process before design studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "After we chose our lot and went through structural upgrades with Dave, we went to design studio to choose designs and trims that go into our house. Maggie was our designer. She was very professional and friendly to work with. We were a picky customer and we changed our choices a lot, but she was very nice and understanding. She also suggested us a lot in terms of choosing. Now our home looks amazing thanks to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were done with choices, Tammy was able to take care of all the questions we had. I think that building a home with a builder can arise many questions because it is a complex process and some things can be hard to understand. We just had to email Tammy and she was able to answer every question, which gave us a peace of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the home was built and when we were going through warranty process (before closing, after closing), Scott and his team acted quick and worked in a very professional matter. They were paying attention to small details and we were able to correct and fix most of the issues we were able to find. Quality of the build went up higher after we went through home with Scott.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole process of purchasing a house from Activa was easier than what we expected and they were very professional. We would recommend Activa to any buyers who are willing to purchase a house from builder. Activa will get you a great quality home with less headaches you have to get. We appreciate Activa’s professionalism, and for a great house.\n",

Alma was at my house and had the furnace installed within hours on the same day! The installers were professional and positive, respectful of my home and helpful with information and letting me know what was happening.  The office staff were equally wonderful to work with and of course, I love my new Lennox furnace...it's so quiet and runs like a charm! Thank you, Alma, for doing a great job and caring about your customer! I highly recommend Alma to everyone!\n",

      "Review Text: Customer for 10 years  have had service in the past.  Recently called for info on a warning light on the furnace and they said they couldn't help me and directed me elsewhere.  Tried to return a brand new furnace filter over $40 value, again after buying them twice yearly for 10 years  and Shane tells me they don't have a return policy.  So $800 worth of filters I buy, but when I need to return one extra I purchased they won't return it.  Poor business etiquette, definitely would not recommend them.  Customer service goes a long way, and here there is zero so why give them business.\n",

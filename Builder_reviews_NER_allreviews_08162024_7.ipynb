As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!  \n",

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.  \n",

The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.  Kudos all round.  "

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!</td>\n",

The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

Installers and electricians ready to go. As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!   \n",

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them   \n",

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.   \n",

The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.

So it's now in a spot that doesn't even warm the rest of the basement just the laundry room.\\n-drain hose was just placed in the laundry room sink not ran outside the way it should be.\\n-only had it for a couple of months, the head upstairs doesn't blow heat just cold air.\\n-outside condenser makes loud clunking noises also condenser was installed right In front of a dryer vent which causes lots of lent build up on coils of condenser.\\n-We paid extra for parts and labor warranty only for them to make us trouble shoot it ourselves or we would have to pay extra for someone to come.\\n-very rude on the phone and lies.\\n-not considered that we have a newborn and another child in the house and our heating not working and power bill going through the roof because we're using space heaters, so much for saving money by switching to heat pumps.\\n- calls us saying a tech will FINALLY be by only for them to not show up, no text, emails or phone Calls explaining why they didn't.\\n\\nWe could go on and on!   \n",

Thanks to his expertise, we were able to secure a fantastic product deal, and the entire process, from signing to financing, took just an hour.

Their dedication to quality service is truly commendable. I wholeheartedly give them five stars and am grateful to George for his outstanding assistance.\"   \n",

Garbage company very ignorance. Yes got free ecobee thermostat, instilled by very unprofessional elections. Most of employees do not know what they are doing after the installation we had problem with the ac and called them I addressed the matter to them they come right away and fix the problem here was some wiring issue that they did not do right. We had same problem yesterday after tring to put our heat on cold air coming when I called and addressed the matter to Melanie she starts giving attitude and claiming that we got the  free service and should not call them anymore. Also she claimed that we do not know how to use the ecobee thermostat. The problem is been resolved by different companies and had to pay $300 for their mistakes.

At first they told me I was wrong and that it was done exactly as I had asked, then they said they could arrange to have it moved but I would not only have to pay for that but would also have to pay for the damages to my home myself, they now have not responded other than to tell me that they will get back to me for over a month   \n",

We just recently bought a home and found out shortly after that our AC was broken. With summer just around the corner we were happy that we were able to install a new unit so quickly! I’m so grateful for the great customer service we received when it came to figuring out what option was best, installation, etc. I would recommend to all friends and family!   \n",

The team was amazing, from our initial discussions with Ryan to get contracts in place to working with our PM on a daily basis. Jocelyn (our PM) was an absolute pleasure to work with, she looked after everything for us. She had put together a great team, provided us with updates throughout the project and took the care of all the details as if it was her own house being worked on. Highly recommend Alair and would definitely work with them again.   \n",

They actually started the job ahead of schedule, and finished even more quickly than I expected. They were extremely professional, friendly and accommodating throughout the entire process; from the sale to installation to billing. Not only does the roof look amazing, but after being present throughout the installation process, I know this job was done right. It was a small job but they treated it just as importantly as any other. I am extremely pleased with my new roof!   \n",
              "196  We couldn't be happier with the quality of their work. We had  some very old worn and torn vinyl siding on a section of our house that needed replacing and we have an older detached garage with a low slope roof that was in dire need of a total roof & decking replacement and upgrade. The end results went way above our expectations and their workmanship was stellar. They provide highly detailed and itemized quotes and they explain clearly what the work will entail. On top of that, they're all professional and super friendly and provide excellent lines of communication so you're never in the dark about anything. I highly recommend them!   \n",

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!   \n",

We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them   \n",

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.   \n",

They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL   \n",
              "4      On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.  Kudos all round.   \n",

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought.

Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance.

We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought.

If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options\\u2026 give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I\\u2019ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\\\nMelanie,\\\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\\\n\\\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.

They took care of all details of an electrical upgrade and central heat pump installation.  Work was performed on time when the schedule was determined.\\n\\nThe equipment they used was good equipment for the services provided, they did not cheap out on anything.\\n\\n1Click also are very willing to help with information on the rebates.\\n\\nOnly criticism of 1Click was their initial pricing and final pricing.  From the initial pricing, there was a number of changes with the final price.  I suggest getting a firm quote up front.   \n",
              "51     First off, I want to say that the contracted installers were amazing, and the staff I worked with were absolutely phenomenal, but...\\nWhen working with them to gather info on what was being installed, I was sent a link to a brochure, and used that brochure to make a judgment call to move forward with the install. After the install was done, the model of the indoor units sent in the brochure were different than the units installed, and were missing features I thought would be included. Note that this was an error on the sales rep side, not the installer. They installed exactly what was expected to be installed by the work order.\\nNow, I work in customer service, and I know misunderstandings happen, and our sales rep did all the things I would expect and escalated the concern (again, although frustrated, still doing what I'd expect them to do). But then I got to the owner, and had thought we had come to a pretty reasonable compromise.\\nThe units all work great, but we need the WiFi component to manage the house while we are away and integrate it to our smart home setup. The brochure said Wifi Enabled, so we expected it to be Wifi enabled, but they weren't. In talking with the owner we deciphered all of the confusion and we had agreed to split the cost to add the wifi modules, and he would contact me back in a few days to confirm cost. I even offered to install it myself so they wouldn't need to pay labour costs for it.\\nIt's been a week after we talked, and despite calling and leaving voicemails, I haven't gotten anything back from him about this, and right or wrong, I paid for the install they did despite this misunderstanding still working to be resolved. I'm now working to find modules on my own to give the functionality I expected since the owner has gone silent.\\nThe short version of all this is to be sure to do extra research and question everything. I'm still really happy with the Heat Pumps, but disappointed in how the last bit of this came to be. This is the first major renovation we wanted for our first home we just bought, and refusing to let this ruin that milestone. Just be sure to triple check the info recieved with the installer so you are getting what you expect   \n",

I still maintain that the installation could have been done a lot better. This update is mostly because of the excellent post installation response and repair of a leak that was discovered near the chimney. Glen had his guys over twice (within a day of calling) and repaired the flashing around the chimney. No more leaks (fingers crossed).\\n\\nWe signed a contract with 1st Choice home solutions to replace our roof in June 2019 and this time around the experience has been a lot different compared to 2016. Communication and organisation on their side is sub par. Have delayed the roof installation twice and all I hear is excuses. This used to be a good company. Not sure what is going on. Not the same company I dealt with in 2016.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\nWe have been in our home for 20 years now and have had some experience with contractors, some good and some bad. Glen and his team have been just about the most professional we have ever had the pleasure to work with. We had all our windows replaced with new Wardco vinyl windows. These were by far the best windows we were quoted. Great quality at a reasonable price. We even got a glass upgrade for better energy efficiency. The installation happened on the day that we booked (why can't all contractors show up when they say they will) and the installation team was amazing. Quick, efficient, clean and professional. They installed 17 windows in one day and cleaned up nicely after themselves. The capping was just superb. No more painting for me. They even inspected all windows to make sure they open and close with no problems and answered all our questions. Great experience. Thanks   \n",

The store's inventory is small and they must order in almost everything - fair enough. After loading my order in the car, I read the Return Policy on the sales receipt. The owner reassured me unopened boxes or materials could be returned within a reasonable timeframe - fair enough.\\n\\nAnyhow, 17 days later, I wanted to return one unopened box of tiles (~$150 value) as minimizing waste is my specialty. However, the sales clerk (probably Tina) stated it would be subject to a 25% restocking fee. Hence, I'll keep the tiles. Needless to say, A&E needs to clearly state, in plain view to all paying customers their Return Policy before finalizing the transaction.\\n\\nElvis mentioned several times his 30+ years in the tile business - this is great. But to make returns so difficult and undigestable makes one want to run from the store. I cannot endorse this store policy and will be forced to promote the big chains as their \"no-fuss\" returns are why they are so popular in this day and age when money is tight.

It is almost 2100 sq ft.  Their standard options in cabinetry, tiles, countertop and carpeting are pretty good.  I only wish the windows were of better quality.  I love the wall to wall carpeting we chose for the home. But whoever installed the carpet did not do a good job. The floor plan is good on the top floor.  The ground floor plan could be better. The supposed family-room adjoining the kitchen is more suitable as a dining room.  The kitchen size is good.    At first it was a bit of a challenge to furnish the house as all the sizes and dimensions are non-standard.  overall I do like the house we bought.   \n",

I will recommend to make the allotment process a little bit more easy and fair. At present it is complicated.

              "36     0                                        The guys showed up in full force! Installers and electricians ready to go. As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\n\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.

Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.

              "      <td>First off, I want to say that the contracted installers were amazing, and the staff I worked with were absolutely phenomenal, but...\\nWhen working with them to gather info on what was being installed, I was sent a link to a brochure, and used that brochure to make a judgment call to move forward with the install. After the install was done, the model of the indoor units sent in the brochure were different than the units installed, and were missing features I thought would be included. Note that this was an error on the sales rep side, not the installer. They installed exactly what was expected to be installed by the work order.\\nNow, I work in customer service, and I know misunderstandings happen, and our sales rep did all the things I would expect and escalated the concern (again, although frustrated, still doing what I'd expect them to do). But then I got to the owner, and had thought we had come to a pretty reasonable compromise.\\nThe units all work great, but we need the WiFi component to manage the house while we are away and integrate it to our smart home setup. The brochure said Wifi Enabled, so we expected it to be Wifi enabled, but they weren't. In talking with the owner we deciphered all of the confusion and we had agreed to split the cost to add the wifi modules, and he would contact me back in a few days to confirm cost. I even offered to install it myself so they wouldn't need to pay labour costs for it.\\nIt's been a week after we talked, and despite calling and leaving voicemails, I haven't gotten anything back from him about this, and right or wrong, I paid for the install they did despite this misunderstanding still working to be resolved. I'm now working to find modules on my own to give the functionality I expected since the owner has gone silent.\\nThe short version of all this is to be sure to do extra research and question everything. I'm still really happy with the Heat Pumps, but disappointed in how the last bit of this came to be. This is the first major renovation we wanted for our first home we just bought, and refusing to let this ruin that milestone. Just be sure to triple check the info recieved with the installer so you are getting what you expect</td>\n",

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I’ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\nMelanie,\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\n\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.

              "      <td>I decided to come back and update my review of 1st choice home solutions and change the star rating. I still maintain that the installation could have been done a lot better. This update is mostly because of the excellent post installation response and repair of a leak that was discovered near the chimney. Glen had his guys over twice (within a day of calling) and repaired the flashing around the chimney. No more leaks (fingers crossed).\\n\\nWe signed a contract with 1st Choice home solutions to replace our roof in June 2019 and this time around the experience has been a lot different compared to 2016. Communication and organisation on their side is sub par. Have delayed the roof installation twice and all I hear is excuses. This used to be a good company. Not sure what is going on. Not the same company I dealt with in 2016.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\nWe have been in our home for 20 years now and have had some experience with contractors, some good and some bad. Glen and his team have been just about the most professional we have ever had the pleasure to work with. We had all our windows replaced with new Wardco vinyl windows. These were by far the best windows we were quoted. Great quality at a reasonable price. We even got a glass upgrade for better energy efficiency. The installation happened on the day that we booked (why can't all contractors show up when they say they will) and the installation team was amazing. Quick, efficient, clean and professional. They installed 17 windows in one day and cleaned up nicely after themselves. The capping was just superb. No more painting for me. They even inspected all windows to make sure they open and close with no problems and answered all our questions. Great experience. Thanks</td>\n",

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

The store's inventory is small and they must order in almost everything - fair enough. After loading my order in the car, I read the Return Policy on the sales receipt. The owner reassured me unopened boxes or materials could be returned within a reasonable timeframe - fair enough.\\n\\nAnyhow, 17 days later, I wanted to return one unopened box of tiles (~$150 value) as minimizing waste is my specialty. However, the sales clerk (probably Tina) stated it would be subject to a 25% restocking fee. Hence, I'll keep the tiles. Needless to say, A&amp;E needs to clearly state, in plain view to all paying customers their Return Policy before finalizing the transaction.\\n\\nElvis mentioned several times his 30+ years in the tile business - this is great. But to make returns so difficult and undigestable makes one want to run from the store. I cannot endorse this store policy and will be forced to promote the big chains as their \"no-fuss\" returns are why they are so popular in this day and age when money is tight. A&amp;E on the otherhand, look desperate to stay in business with their return policy.\\n\\nYou have been warned!</td>\n",

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

Their standard options in cabinetry, tiles, countertop and carpeting are pretty good.  I only wish the windows were of better quality.  I love the wall to wall carpeting we chose for the home. But whoever installed the carpet did not do a good job. The floor plan is good on the top floor.  The ground floor plan could be better. The supposed family-room adjoining the kitchen is more suitable as a dining room.  The kitchen size is good.    At first it was a bit of a challenge to furnish the house as all the sizes and dimensions are non-standard.  overall I do like the house we bought.</td>\n",

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options… give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat &amp; air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free.

Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends.

Installers and electricians ready to go. As a small business owner, I appreciate the coordination in doing such a job in a timely manner. 1st thing I noticed, was the relatively young age of the crew, which was a pleasant surprise! I know all too well how hard it is to recruit young workers these days. The crew was very knowledgeable in their field and worked together flawlessly. Adrianna and Mike at 1-click were great to deal with, and made the transition from oil to electric go very smoothly. No money up front, as a lot of people thought. If you qualify for a government rebate, you only pay for the remaining balance, which they will finance for you if need be and at a reasonable rate. If you are thinking of making the transition from oil to electric or looking for other options\\u2026 give 1-click a call and speak to Mike or Adrianna!\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Working with 1 Click to set up our ductless heat & air conditioning in our home in Nova Scotia has been seamlessly, worry free. Our rep George was very transparent and knowledgeable. He was and is always available to answer any questions or guidance. The installers are some of most respectful workers I\\u2019ve ever had in my home, their workmanship was impeccable! Extremely neat and professional. We would definitely recommend George and 1 Click based on our experience with them\\n2                                                             We knew we wanted a heat pump, but we didn't know what type was best. Originally, we considered a ducted unit, but in the end, we chose a multi split. We have 3 heads to best service our home. Kingsley was very patient and helpful with us and our indecisiveness.  He helped us choose the right unit for us.  The installation went smoothly.  The team was efficient and tidy. The units look great. Kingsley and the other members of the 1click team kept us informed of all the services and helped us with all our questions. They were very patient with us, considering we were completing other renovateds to our home and at one point, only had a small hole to access the basement. Kingsley even helped us with the application and financing websites. I would highly recommend this service to friends. I'm now enjoying the comfort of multi zone climate control.\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was an absolute pleasure working with this company, especially Adrianna, Dylan and George. They were available and extremely helpful every step of the way, even though I know I must have drove them crazy at times. I would highly recommend 1click to anyone looking to install a heat pump and wanting to take advantage of the rebates being offered.\\\\nMelanie,\\\\nPort aux Basques, NL\\n4        On Labour Day Weekend I filled out a basic request for a quote and by noon on the Tuesday following the long weekend Kage had reached out and not only offered a written quote but financing options for the modest amount not covered by Rebates and the information required to complete the Rebate Application.\\\\n\\\\nWhile waiting for Rebate Approval, they touched base weekly and one day after confirmation, co-ordinated Electrical and HVAC Companies (from two different areas of the Province) and an Installation date.  The contractors showed up on-time and were professional, respectful, knowledgable and surprisingly young.\\\\n\\\\nBy mid afternoon, a heat pump, and three heads had been neatly installed and working; and the oil tank removed.  From an office in Toronto to the rural town of Sandy Cove, Newfoundland; 1Click and its sub-contractors made the whole experience smooth and hassel free.
